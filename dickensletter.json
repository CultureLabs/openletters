It is odd enough that an old lady, who had been outside all\nday and came in towards dinner time, turned out to be the mistress of a\nYorkshire school returning from the holiday stay in London. She was a\nvery queer old lady, and showed us a long letter she was carrying to one\nof the boys from his father, containing a severe lecture (enforced and\naided by many texts of Scripture) on his refusing to eat boiled meat.\nShe was very communicative, drank a great deal of brandy and water, and\ntowards evening became insensible, in which state we left her.\n\nYesterday we were up again shortly after seven A.M., came on upon our\njourney by the Glasgow mail, which charged us the remarkably low sum of\nsix pounds fare for two places inside. We had a very droll male\ncompanion until seven o'clock in the evening, and a most delicious\nlady's-maid for twenty miles, who implored us to keep a sharp look-out\nat the coach-windows, as she expected the carriage was coming to meet\nher and she was afraid of missing it. We had many delightful vauntings\nof the same kind; but in the end it is scarcely necessary to say that\nthe coach did not come, but a very dirty girl did.\n\nAs we came further north the mire grew deeper. About eight o'clock it\nbegan to fall heavily, and, as we crossed the wild heaths hereabout,\nthere was no vestige of a track. The mail kept on well, however, and at\neleven we reached a bare place with a house standing alone in the midst\nof a dreary moor, which the guard informed us was Greta Bridge. I was in\na perfect agony of apprehension, for it was fearfully cold, and there\nwere no outward signs of anybody being up in the house. But to our great\njoy we discovered a comfortable room, with drawn curtains and a most\nblazing fire. In half an hour they gave us a smoking supper and a bottle\nof mulled port (in which we drank your health), and then we retired to\na couple of capital bedrooms, in each of which there was a rousing fire\nhalfway up the chimney.\n\nWe have had for breakfast, toast, cakes, a Yorkshire pie, a piece of\nbeef about the size and much the shape of my portmanteau, tea, coffee,\nham, and eggs; and are now going to look about us. Having finished our\ndiscoveries, we start in a postchaise for Barnard Castle, which is only\nfour miles off, and there I deliver the letter given me by Mitton's\nfriend. All the schools are round about that place, and a dozen old\nabbeys besides, which we shall visit by some means or other to-morrow.\nWe shall reach York on Saturday I hope, and (God willing) I trust I\nshall be at home on Wednesday morning.\n\nI wish you would call on Mrs. Bentley and thank her for the letter; you\ncan tell her when I expect to be in York.\n\nA thousand loves and kisses to the darling boy, whom I see in my mind's\neye crawling about the floor of this Yorkshire inn. Bless his heart, I\nwould give two sovereigns for a kiss. Remember me too to Frederick, who\nI hope is attentive to you.\n\nIs it not extraordinary that the same dreams which have constantly\nvisited me since poor Mary died follow me everywhere? After all the\nchange of scene and fatigue, I have dreamt of her ever since I left\nhome, and no doubt shall till I return. I should be sorry to lose such\nvisions, for they are very happy ones, if it be only the seeing her in\none's sleep. I would fain believe, too, sometimes, that her spirit may\nhave some influence over them, but their perpetual repetition is\nextraordinary.\n\nLove to all friends.\n\n                                 Ever, my dear Kate,\n                                            Your affectionate Husband.",

It is indispensably\nnecessary that \"Oliver Twist\" should be published in three volumes, in\nSeptember next. I have only just begun the last one, and, having the\nconstant drawback of my monthly work, shall be sadly harassed to get it\nfinished in time, especially as I have several very important scenes\n(important to the story I mean) yet to write. Nothing would give me so\nmuch pleasure as to be with you for a week or so. I can only imperfectly\nconsole myself with the hope that when you see \"Oliver\" you will like\nthe close of the book, and approve my self-denial in staying here to\nwrite it. I should like to know your address in Scotland when you leave\ntown, so that I may send you the earliest copy if it be produced in the\nvacation, which I pray Heaven it may.\n\nMeanwhile, believe that though my body is on the banks of the Thames,\nhalf my heart is going the Oxford circuit.\n\nMrs. Dickens and Charley desire their best remembrances (the latter\nexpresses some anxiety, not unmixed with apprehension, relative to the\nCopyright Bill, in which he conceives himself interested), with hearty\nwishes that you may have a fine autumn, which is all you want, being\nsure of all other means of enjoyment that a man can have.\n\n                              I am, my dear Talfourd,\n                                                Ever faithfully yours.\n\nP.S.--I hope you are able to spare a moment now and then to glance at\n\"Nicholas Nickleby,\" and that you have as yet found no reason to alter\nthe opinion you formed on the appearance of the first number.\n\nYou know, I suppose, that they elected me at the Athenaeum?

I hope that\nin your next, or your next but one, I shall learn that they are quite\nwell. A thousand kisses to them. I wish I could convey them myself.\n\nWe found a roaring fire, an elegant dinner, a snug room, and capital\nbeds all ready for us at Leamington, after a very agreeable (but very\ncold) ride. We started in a postchaise next morning for Kenilworth, with\nwhich we were both enraptured, and where I really think we MUST have\nlodgings next summer, please God that we are in good health and all goes\nwell. You cannot conceive how delightful it is. To read among the ruins\nin fine weather would be perfect luxury. From here we went on to Warwick\nCastle, which is an ancient building, newly restored, and possessing no\nvery great attraction beyond a fine view and some beautiful pictures;\nand thence to Stratford-upon-Avon, where we sat down in the room where\nShakespeare was born, and left our autographs and read those of other\npeople and so forth.\n\nWe remained at Stratford all night, and found to our unspeakable dismay\nthat father's plan of proceeding by Bridgenorth was impracticable, as\nthere were no coaches. So we were compelled to come here by way of\nBirmingham and Wolverhampton, starting at eight o'clock through a cold\nwet fog, and travelling, when the day had cleared up, through miles of\ncinder-paths and blazing furnaces, and roaring steam-engines, and such a\nmass of dirt, gloom, and misery as I never before witnessed. We got\npretty well accommodated here when we arrived at half-past four, and are\nnow going off in a postchaise to Llangollen--thirty miles--where we\nshall remain to-night, and where the Bangor mail will take us up\nto-morrow.

I can say positively that I shall not exceed the\nfortnight, and I think it very possible that I may return a day or two\nbefore it expires.\n\nWe were at the play last night. It was a bespeak--\"The Love Chase,\" a\nballet (with a phenomenon!), divers songs, and \"A Roland for an Oliver.\"\nIt is a good theatre, but the actors are very funny. Browne laughed with\nsuch indecent heartiness at one point of the entertainment, that an old\ngentleman in the next box suffered the most violent indignation. The\nbespeak party occupied two boxes, the ladies were full-dressed, and the\ngentlemen, to a man, in white gloves with flowers in their button-holes.\nIt amused us mightily, and was really as like the Miss Snevellicci\nbusiness as it could well be.\n\nMy side has been very bad since I left home, although I have been very\ncareful not to drink much, remaining to the full as abstemious as usual,\nand have not eaten any great quantity, having no appetite. I suffered\nsuch an ecstasy of pain all night at Stratford that I was half dead\nyesterday, and was obliged last night to take a dose of henbane. The\neffect was most delicious. I slept soundly, and without feeling the\nleast uneasiness, and am a great deal better this morning; neither do I\nfind that the henbane has affected my head, which, from the great effect\nit had upon me--exhilarating me to the most extraordinary degree, and\nyet keeping me sleepy--I feared it would. If I had not got better I\nshould have turned back to Birmingham, and come straight home by the\nrailroad. As it is, I hope I shall make out the trip.\n\nGod bless you, my darling.

There is a good garden at the side well stocked with cabbages,\nbeans, onions, celery, and some flowers. The stock belonging to the\nlandlady (who lives in the adjoining cottage), there was some question\nwhether she was not entitled to half the produce, but I settled the\npoint by paying five shillings, and becoming absolute master of the\nwhole!\n\nI do assure you that I am charmed with the place and the beauty of the\ncountry round about, though I have not seen it under very favourable\ncircumstances, for it snowed when I was there this morning, and blew\nbitterly from the east yesterday. It is really delightful, and when the\nhouse is to rights and the furniture all in, I shall be quite sorry to\nleave it. I have had some few things second-hand, but I take it seventy\npounds will be the mark, even taking this into consideration. I include\nin that estimate glass and crockery, garden tools, and such like little\nthings. There is a spare bedroom of course. That I have furnished too.\n\nI am on terms of the closest intimacy with Mrs. Samuell, the landlady,\nand her brother and sister-in-law, who have a little farm hard by. They\nare capital specimens of country folks, and I really think the old woman\nherself will be a great comfort to my mother. Coals are dear just\nnow--twenty-six shillings a ton. They found me a boy to go two miles out\nand back again to order some this morning. I was debating in my mind\nwhether I should give him eighteenpence or two shillings, when his fee\nwas announced--twopence!\n\nThe house is on the high road to Plymouth, and, though in the very heart\nof Devonshire, there is as much long-stage and posting life as you would\nfind in Piccadilly. The situation is charming. Meadows in front, an\norchard running parallel to the garden hedge, richly-wooded hills\nclosing in the prospect behind, and, away to the left, before a splendid\nview of the hill on which Exeter is situated, the cathedral towers\nrising up into the sky in the most picturesque manner possible. I don't\nthink I ever saw so cheerful or pleasant a spot. The drawing-room is\nnearly, if not quite, as large as the outer room of my old chambers in\nFurnival's Inn. The paint and paper are new, and the place clean as the\nutmost excess of snowy cleanliness can be.\n\nYou would laugh if you could see me powdering away with the upholsterer,\nand endeavouring to bring about all sorts of impracticable reductions\nand wonderful arrangements. He has by him two second-hand carpets; the\nimportant ceremony of trying the same comes off at three this afternoon.\nI am perpetually going backwards and forwards. It is two miles from\nhere, so I have plenty of exercise, which so occupies me and prevents my\nbeing lonely that I stopped at home to read last night, and shall\nto-night, although the theatre is open. Charles Kean has been the star\nfor the last two evenings. He was stopping in this house, and went away\nthis morning. I have got his sitting-room now, which is smaller and more\ncomfortable than the one I had before.\n\nYou will have heard perhaps that I wrote to my mother to come down\nto-morrow. There are so many things she can make comfortable at a much\nless expense than I could, that I thought it best. If I had not, I could\nnot have returned on Monday, which I now hope to do, and to be in town\nat half-past eight.\n\nWill you tell my father that if he could devise any means of bringing\nhim down, I think it would be a great thing for him to have Dash, if it\nbe only to keep down the trampers and beggars.

I accept the\noffice with hearty and fervent satisfaction; and, to render this\npleasant bond between us the more complete, I must solicit you to become\ngodfather to the last and final branch of a genteel small family of\nthree which I am told may be looked for in that auspicious month when\nLord Mayors are born and guys prevail. This I look upon as a bargain\nbetween us, and I have shaken hands with you in spirit upon it. Family\ntopics remind me of Mr. Kenwigs. As the weather is wet, and he is about\nto make his last appearance on my little stage, I send Mrs. Macready an\nearly proof of the next number, containing an account of his baby's\nprogress.\n\nI am going to send you something else on Monday--a tragedy. Don't be\nalarmed. I didn't write it, nor do I want it acted. A young Scotch lady\nwhom I don't know (but she is evidently very intelligent and\naccomplished) has sent me a translation of a German play, soliciting my\naid and advice in the matter of its publication. Among a crowd of\nGermanisms, there are many things in it which are so very striking, that\nI am sure it will amuse you very much. At least I think it will; it has\nme. I am going to send it back to her--when I come to Elstree will be\ntime enough; and meantime, if you bestow a couple of hours upon it, you\nwill not think them thrown away.\n\nIt's a large parcel, and I must keep it here till somebody goes up to\ntown and can book it by the coach. I warrant it, large as it looks,\nreadable in two hours; and I very much want to know what you think of\nthe first act, and especially the opening, which seems to me quite\nfamous. The metre is very odd and rough, but now and then there's a\nwildness in it which helps the thing very much; and altogether it has\nleft a something on my mind which I can't get rid of.\n\nMrs. Dickens joins with me in kindest regards to yourself, Mrs., and\nMiss Macready. And I am always,\n\n                                     My dear Macready,\n                                           Faithfully and truly yours.\n\nP.S.--A dreadful thought has just occurred to me--that this is a\nquadruple letter, and that Elstree may not be within the twopenny post.\nPray Heaven my fears are unfounded.",

My now periodical\nwork appears--or I should rather say the first number does--on Saturday,\nthe 28th of March; and as it has to be sent to America and Germany, and\nmust therefore be considerably in advance, it is now in hand; I having\nin fact begun it on Saturday last. Instead of being published in monthly\nparts at a shilling each only, it will be published in weekly parts at\nthreepence and monthly parts at a shilling; my object being to baffle\nthe imitators and make it as novel as possible. The plan is a new one--I\nmean the plan of the fiction--and it will comprehend a great variety of\ntales. The title is: \"Master Humphrey's Clock.\"\n\nNow, among other improvements, I have turned my attention to the\nillustrations, meaning to have woodcuts dropped into the text and no\nseparate plates. I want to know whether you would object to make me a\nlittle sketch for a woodcut--in indian-ink would be quite\nsufficient--about the size of the enclosed scrap; the subject, an old\nquaint room with antique Elizabethan furniture, and in the\nchimney-corner an extraordinary old clock--the clock belonging to Master\nHumphrey, in fact, and no figures. This I should drop into the text at\nthe head of my opening page.\n\nI want to know besides--as Chapman and Hall are my partners in the\nmatter, there need be no delicacy about my asking or your answering the\nquestion--what would be your charge for such a thing, and whether (if\nthe work answers our expectations) you would like to repeat the joke at\nregular intervals, and, if so, on what terms? I should tell you that I\nintend to ask Maclise to join me likewise, and that the copying the\ndrawing on wood and the cutting will be done in first-rate style.

I make it as brief as possible. Read it\nwhen you have time. As we were the first experimentalists last night you\nwill be glad to know what it wants.\n\nFirst, the refreshments are preposterously dear. A glass of wine is a\nshilling, and it ought to be sixpence.\n\nSecondly, they were served out by the wrong sort of people--two most\nuncomfortable drabs of women, and a dirty man with his hat on.\n\nThirdly, there ought to be a box-keeper to ring a bell or give some\nother notice of the commencement of the overture to the after-piece. The\npromenaders were in a perpetual fret and worry to get back again.\n\nAnd fourthly, and most important of all--if the plan is ever to\nsucceed--you must have some notice up to the effect that as it is now a\nplace of resort for ladies, gentlemen are requested not to lounge there\nin their hats and greatcoats. No ladies will go there, though the\nconveniences should be ten thousand times greater, while the sort of\nswells who have been used to kick their heels there do so in the old\nsort of way. I saw this expressed last night more strongly than I can\ntell you.\n\nHearty congratulations on the brilliant triumph. I have always expected\none, as you know, but nobody could have imagined the reality.\n\n                                Always, my dear Macready,\n                                                 Affectionately yours.",

Our luggage is now aboard. Anything so\nutterly and monstrously absurd as the size of our cabin, no \"gentleman\nof England who lives at home at ease\" can for a moment imagine. Neither\nof the portmanteaus would go into it. There!\n\nThese Cunard packets are not very big you know actually, but the\nquantity of sleeping-berths makes them much smaller, so that the saloon\nis not nearly as large as in one of the Ramsgate boats. The ladies'\ncabin is so close to ours that I could knock the door open without\ngetting off something they call my bed, but which I believe to be a\nmuffin beaten flat. This is a great comfort, for it is an excellent room\n(the only good one in the ship); and if there be only one other lady\nbesides Kate, as the stewardess thinks, I hope I shall be able to sit\nthere very often.\n\nThey talk of seventy passengers, but I can't think there will be so\nmany; they talk besides (which is even more to the purpose) of a very\nfine passage, having had a noble one this time last year. God send it\nso! We are in the best spirits, and full of hope. I was dashed for a\nmoment when I saw our \"cabin,\" but I got over that directly, and laughed\nso much at its ludicrous proportions, that you might have heard me all\nover the ship.\n\nGod bless you!

Forster has it, in trust, to\ntell you all its news; and he has also some newspapers which I had an\nopportunity of sending him, in which you will find further particulars\nof our progress.\n\nWe had a dreadful passage, the worst, the officers all concur in saying,\nthat they have ever known. We were eighteen days coming; experienced a\ndreadful storm which swept away our paddle-boxes and stove our\nlifeboats; and ran aground besides, near Halifax, among rocks and\nbreakers, where we lay at anchor all night. After we left the English\nChannel we had only one fine day. And we had the additional discomfort\nof being eighty-six passengers. I was ill five days, Kate six; though,\nindeed, she had a swelled face and suffered the utmost terror all the\nway.\n\nI can give you no conception of my welcome here. There never was a king\nor emperor upon the earth so cheered and followed by crowds, and\nentertained in public at splendid balls and dinners, and waited on by\npublic bodies and deputations of all kinds. I have had one from the Far\nWest--a journey of two thousand miles! If I go out in a carriage, the\ncrowd surround it and escort me home; if I go to the theatre, the whole\nhouse (crowded to the roof) rises as one man, and the timbers ring\nagain. You cannot imagine what it is. I have five great public dinners\non hand at this moment, and invitations from every town and village and\ncity in the States.\n\nThere is a great deal afloat here in the way of subjects for\ndescription.

Are you quite sure you designed that remark for me? Have\nyou not, in the hurry of correspondence, slipped a paragraph into my\nletter which belongs of right to somebody else? When did you ever find\nme leap at wrong conclusions? I pause for a reply.\n\nPray, sir, did you ever find me admiring Mr. ----? On the contrary, did\nyou never hear of my protesting through good, better, and best report\nthat he was not an open or a candid man, and would one day, beyond all\ndoubt, displease you by not being so? I pause again for a reply.\n\nAre you quite sure, Mr. Macready--and I address myself to you with the\nsternness of a man in the pit--are you quite sure, sir, that you do not\nview America through the pleasant mirage which often surrounds a thing\nthat has been, but not a thing that is? Are you quite sure that when you\nwere here you relished it as well as you do now when you look back upon\nit. The early spring birds, Mr. Macready, _do_ sing in the groves that\nyou were, very often, not over well pleased with many of the new\ncountry's social aspects. Are the birds to be trusted? Again I pause for\na reply.\n\nMy dear Macready, I desire to be so honest and just to those who have so\nenthusiastically and earnestly welcomed me, that I burned the last\nletter I wrote to you--even to you to whom I would speak as to\nmyself--rather than let it come with anything that might seem like an\nill-considered word of disappointment. I preferred that you should think\nme neglectful (if you could imagine anything so wild) rather than I\nshould do wrong in this respect. Still it is of no use. I _am_\ndisappointed. This is not the republic I came to see; this is not the\nrepublic of my imagination. I infinitely prefer a liberal monarchy--even\nwith its sickening accompaniments of court circulars--to such a\ngovernment as this. The more I think of its youth and strength, the\npoorer and more trifling in a thousand aspects it appears in my eyes. In\neverything of which it has made a boast--excepting its education of the\npeople and its care for poor children--it sinks immeasurably below the\nlevel I had placed it upon; and England, even England, bad and faulty as\nthe old land is, and miserable as millions of her people are, rises in\nthe comparison.\n\n_You_ live here, Macready, as I have sometimes heard you imagining!\n_You!_ Loving you with all my heart and soul, and knowing what your\ndisposition really is, I would not condemn you to a year's residence on\nthis side of the Atlantic for any money. Freedom of opinion! Where is\nit? I see a press more mean, and paltry, and silly, and disgraceful than\nany country I ever knew. If that is its standard, here it is. But I\nspeak of Bancroft, and am advised to be silent on that subject, for he\nis \"a black sheep--a Democrat.\" I speak of Bryant, and am entreated to\nbe more careful, for the same reason. I speak of international\ncopyright, and am implored not to ruin myself outright. I speak of Miss\nMartineau, and all parties--Slave Upholders and Abolitionists, Whigs,\nTyler Whigs, and Democrats, shower down upon me a perfect cataract of\nabuse. \"But what has she done? Surely she praised America enough!\" \"Yes,\nbut she told us of some of our faults, and Americans can't bear to be\ntold of their faults. Don't split on that rock, Mr. Dickens, don't write\nabout America; we are so very suspicious.\"\n\nFreedom of opinion! Macready, if I had been born here and had written my\nbooks in this country, producing them with no stamp of approval from any\nother land, it is my solemn belief that I should have lived and died\npoor, unnoticed, and a \"black sheep\" to boot. I never was more convinced\nof anything than I am of that.\n\nThe people are affectionate, generous, open-hearted, hospitable,\nenthusiastic, good-humoured, polite to women, frank and candid to all\nstrangers, anxious to oblige, far less prejudiced than they have been\ndescribed to be, frequently polished and refined, very seldom rude or\ndisagreeable. I have made a great many friends here, even in public\nconveyances, whom I have been truly sorry to part from. In the towns I\nhave formed perfect attachments. I have seen none of that greediness and\nindecorousness on which travellers have laid so much emphasis. I have\nreturned frankness with frankness; met questions not intended to be\nrude, with answers meant to be satisfactory; and have not spoken to one\nman, woman, or child of any degree who has not grown positively\naffectionate before we parted. In the respects of not being left alone,\nand of being horribly disgusted by tobacco chewing and tobacco spittle,\nI have suffered considerably. The sight of slavery in Virginia, the\nhatred of British feeling upon the subject, and the miserable hints of\nthe impotent indignation of the South, have pained me very much; on the\nlast head, of course, I have felt nothing but a mingled pity and\namusement; on the other, sheer distress. But however much I like the\ningredients of this great dish, I cannot but come back to the point upon\nwhich I started, and say that the dish itself goes against the grain\nwith me, and that I don't like it.\n\nYou know that I am truly a Liberal. I believe I have as little pride as\nmost men, and I am conscious of not the smallest annoyance from being\n\"hail fellow well met\" with everybody. I have not had greater pleasure\nin the company of any set of men among the thousands I have received (I\nhold a regular levee every day, you know, which is duly heralded and\nproclaimed in the newspapers) than in that of the carmen of Hertford,\nwho presented themselves in a body in their blue frocks, among a crowd\nof well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, and bade me welcome through their\nspokesman. They had all read my books, and all perfectly understood\nthem. It is not these things I have in my mind when I say that the man\nwho comes to this country a Radical and goes home again with his\nopinions unchanged, must be a Radical on reason, sympathy, and\nreflection, and one who has so well considered the subject that he has\nno chance of wavering.\n\nWe have been to Boston, Worcester, Hertford, New Haven, New York,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Fredericksburgh, Richmond, and back\nto Washington again. The premature heat of the weather (it was eighty\nyesterday in the shade) and Clay's advice--how you would like\nClay!--have made us determine not to go to Charleston; but having got to\nRichmond, I think I should have turned back under any circumstances. We\nremain at Baltimore for two days, of which this is one; then we go to\nHarrisburgh. Then by the canal boat and the railroad over the Alleghany\nMountains to Pittsburgh, then down the Ohio to Cincinnati, then to\nLouisville, and then to St. Louis. I have been invited to a public\nentertainment in every town I have entered, and have refused them; but I\nhave excepted St. Louis as the farthest point of my travels. My friends\nthere have passed some resolutions which Forster has, and will show\nyou. From St. Louis we cross to Chicago, traversing immense prairies.\nThence by the lakes and Detroit to Buffalo, and so to Niagara. A run\ninto Canada follows of course, and then--let me write the blessed word\nin capitals--we turn towards HOME.\n\nKate has written to Mrs. Macready, and it is useless for me to thank\nyou, my dearest friend, or her, for your care of our dear children,\nwhich is our constant theme of discourse. Forster has gladdened our\nhearts with his account of the triumph of \"Acis and Galatea,\" and I am\nanxiously looking for news of the tragedy. Forrest breakfasted with us\nat Richmond last Saturday--he was acting there, and I invited him--and\nhe spoke very gratefully, and very like a man, of your kindness to him\nwhen he was in London.\n\nDavid Colden is as good a fellow as ever lived; and I am deeply in love\nwith his wife. Indeed we have received the greatest and most earnest and\nzealous kindness from the whole family, and quite love them all. Do you\nremember one Greenhow, whom you invited to pass some days with you at\nthe hotel on the Kaatskill Mountains? He is translator to the State\nOffice at Washington, has a very pretty wife, and a little girl of five\nyears old. We dined with them, and had a very pleasant day. The\nPresident invited me to dinner, but I couldn't stay for it. I had a\nprivate audience, however, and we attended the public drawing-room\nbesides.\n\nNow, don't you rush at the quick conclusion that I have rushed at a\nquick conclusion. Pray, be upon your guard. If you can by any process\nestimate the extent of my affectionate regard for you, and the rush I\nshall make when I reach London to take you by your true right hand, I\ndon't object. But let me entreat you to be very careful how you come\ndown upon the sharpsighted individual who pens these words, which you\nseem to me to have done in what Willmott would call \"one of Mr.\nMacready's rushes.\" As my pen is getting past its work, I have taken a\nnew one to say that\n\n                               I am ever, my dear Macready,\n                                                 Your faithful Friend.",

For this unexpected reason, and because the country between\nRichmond and Charleston is but a desolate swamp the whole way, and\nbecause slavery is anything but a cheerful thing to live amidst, I have\naltered my route by the advice of Mr. Clay (the great political leader\nin this country), and have returned here previous to diving into the far\nWest. We start for that part of the country--which includes mountain\ntravelling, and lake travelling, and prairie travelling--the day after\nto-morrow, at eight o'clock in the morning; and shall be in the West,\nand from there going northward again, until the 30th of April or 1st of\nMay, when we shall halt for a week at Niagara, before going further into\nCanada. We have taken our passage home (God bless the word) in the\n_George Washington_ packet-ship from New York. She sails on the 7th of\nJune.\n\nI have departed from my resolution not to accept any more public\nentertainments; they have been proposed in every town I have visited--in\nfavour of the people of St. Louis, my utmost western point. That town is\non the borders of the Indian territory, a trifling distance from this\nplace--only two thousand miles! At my second halting-place I shall be\nable to write to fix the day; I suppose it will be somewhere about the\n12th of April. Think of my going so far towards the setting sun to\ndinner!\n\nIn every town where we stay, though it be only for a day, we hold a\nregular levee or drawing-room, where I shake hands on an average with\nfive or six hundred people, who pass on from me to Kate, and are shaken\nagain by her. Maclise's picture of our darlings stands upon a table or\nsideboard the while; and my travelling secretary, assisted very often by\na committee belonging to the place, presents the people in due form.\nThink of two hours of this every day, and the people coming in by\nhundreds, all fresh, and piping hot, and full of questions, when we are\nliterally exhausted and can hardly stand. I really do believe that if I\nhad not a lady with me, I should have been obliged to leave the country\nand go back to England. But for her they never would leave me alone by\nday or night, and as it is, a slave comes to me now and then in the\nmiddle of the night with a letter, and waits at the bedroom door for an\nanswer.\n\nIt was so hot at Richmond that we could scarcely breathe, and the peach\nand other fruit trees were in full blossom; it was so cold at Washington\nnext day that we were shivering; but even in the same town you might\noften wear nothing but a shirt and trousers in the morning, and two\ngreatcoats at night, the thermometer very frequently taking a little\ntrip of thirty degrees between sunrise and sunset.\n\nThey do lay it on at the hotels in such style! They charge by the day,\nso that whether one dines out or dines at home makes no manner of\ndifference. T'other day I wrote to order our rooms at Philadelphia to be\nready on a certain day, and was detained a week longer than I expected\nin New York. The Philadelphia landlord not only charged me half rent\nfor the rooms during the whole of that time, but board for myself and\nKate and Anne during the whole time too, though we were actually\nboarding at the same expense during the same time in New York! What do\nyou say to that? If I remonstrated, the whole virtue of the newspapers\nwould be aroused directly.\n\nWe were at the President's drawing-room while we were in Washington. I\nhad a private audience besides, and was asked to dinner, but couldn't\nstay.\n\nParties--parties--parties--of course, every day and night. But it's not\nall parties. I go into the prisons, the police-offices, the\nwatch-houses, the hospitals, the workhouses. I was out half the night in\nNew York with two of their most famous constables; started at midnight,\nand went into every brothel, thieves' house, murdering hovel, sailors'\ndancing-place, and abode of villany, both black and white, in the town.\nI went _incog._ behind the scenes to the little theatre where Mitchell\nis making a fortune. He has been rearing a little dog for me, and has\ncalled him \"Boz.\"[1] I am going to bring him home. In a word I go\neverywhere, and a hard life it is. But I am careful to drink hardly\nanything, and not to smoke at all. I have recourse to my medicine-chest\nwhenever I feel at all bilious, and am, thank God, thoroughly well.\n\nWhen I next write to you, I shall have begun, I hope, to turn my face\nhomeward. I have a great store of oddity and whimsicality, and am going\nnow into the oddest and most characteristic part of this most queer\ncountry.\n\nAlways direct to the care of David Colden, Esq., 28, Laight Street,\nHudson Square, New York. I received your Caledonia letter with the\ngreatest joy.\n\nKate sends her best remembrances.\n\n                                                      And I am always.\n\nP.S.--Richmond was my extreme southern point, and I turn from the South\naltogether the day after to-morrow.

I shall carry it\non with me to Montreal, and despatch it from there by the steamer which\ngoes to Halifax, to meet the Cunard boat at that place, with Canadian\nletters and passengers. Before I finally close it, I will add a short\npostscript, so that it will contain the latest intelligence.\n\nWe have had a blessed interval of quiet in this beautiful place, of\nwhich, as you may suppose, we stood greatly in need, not only by reason\nof our hard travelling for a long time, but on account of the incessant\npersecutions of the people, by land and water, on stage coach, railway\ncar, and steamer, which exceeds anything you can picture to yourself by\nthe utmost stretch of your imagination. So far we have had this hotel\nnearly to ourselves. It is a large square house, standing on a bold\nheight, with overhanging eaves like a Swiss cottage, and a wide handsome\ngallery outside every story. These colonnades make it look so very\nlight, that it has exactly the appearance of a house built with a pack\nof cards; and I live in bodily terror lest any man should venture to\nstep out of a little observatory on the roof, and crush the whole\nstructure with one stamp of his foot.\n\nOur sitting-room (which is large and low like a nursery) is on the\nsecond floor, and is so close to the Falls that the windows are always\nwet and dim with spray. Two bedrooms open out of it--one our own; one\nAnne's. The secretary slumbers near at hand, but without these sacred\nprecincts. From the three chambers, or any part of them, you can see the\nFalls rolling and tumbling, and roaring and leaping, all day long, with\nbright rainbows making fiery arches down a hundred feet below us. When\nthe sun is on them, they shine and glow like molten gold. When the day\nis gloomy, the water falls like snow, or sometimes it seems to crumble\naway like the face of a great chalk cliff, or sometimes again to roll\nalong the front of the rock like white smoke. But it all seems gay or\ngloomy, dark or light, by sun or moon. From the bottom of both Falls,\nthere is always rising up a solemn ghostly cloud, which hides the\nboiling cauldron from human sight, and makes it in its mystery a hundred\ntimes more grand than if you could see all the secrets that lie hidden\nin its tremendous depth. One Fall is as close to us as York Gate is to\nNo. 1, Devonshire Terrace. The other (the great Horse-shoe Fall) may be,\nperhaps, about half as far off as \"Creedy's.\"[3] One circumstance in\nconnection with them is, in all the accounts, greatly exaggerated--I\nmean the noise. Last night was perfectly still. Kate and I could just\nhear them, at the quiet time of sunset, a mile off. Whereas, believing\nthe statements I had heard I began putting my ear to the ground, like a\nsavage or a bandit in a ballet, thirty miles off, when we were coming\nhere from Buffalo.\n\nI was delighted to receive your famous letter, and to read your account\nof our darlings, whom we long to see with an intensity it is impossible\nto shadow forth, ever so faintly. I do believe, though I say it as\nshouldn't, that they are good 'uns--both to look at and to go. I roared\nout this morning, as soon as I was awake, \"Next month,\" which we have\nbeen longing to be able to say ever since we have been here. I really do\nnot know how we shall ever knock at the door, when that slowest of all\nimpossibly slow hackney-coaches shall pull up--at home.\n\nI am glad you exult in the fight I have had about the copyright. If you\nknew how they tried to stop me, you would have a still greater interest\nin it. The greatest men in England have sent me out, through Forster, a\nvery manly, and becoming, and spirited memorial and address, backing me\nin all I have done. I have despatched it to Boston for publication, and\nam coolly prepared for the storm it will raise. But my best rod is in\npickle.\n\nIs it not a horrible thing that scoundrel booksellers should grow rich\nhere from publishing books, the authors of which do not reap one\nfarthing from their issue by scores of thousands; and that every vile,\nblackguard, and detestable newspaper, so filthy and bestial that no\nhonest man would admit one into his house for a scullery door-mat,\nshould be able to publish those same writings side by side, cheek by\njowl, with the coarsest and most obscene companions with which they must\nbecome connected, in course of time, in people's minds? Is it tolerable\nthat besides being robbed and rifled an author should be forced to\nappear in any form, in any vulgar dress, in any atrocious company; that\nhe should have no choice of his audience, no control over his own\ndistorted text, and that he should be compelled to jostle out of the\ncourse the best men in this country who only ask to live by writing? I\nvow before high heaven that my blood so boils at these enormities, that\nwhen I speak about them I seem to grow twenty feet high, and to swell\nout in proportion. \"Robbers that ye are,\" I think to myself when I get\nupon my legs, \"here goes!\"\n\nThe places we have lodged in, the roads we have gone over, the company\nwe have been among, the tobacco-spittle we have wallowed in, the strange\ncustoms we have complied with, the packing-cases in which we have\ntravelled, the woods, swamps, rivers, prairies, lakes, and mountains we\nhave crossed, are all subjects for legends and tales at home; quires,\nreams, wouldn't hold them. I don't think Anne has so much as seen an\nAmerican tree. She never looks at a prospect by any chance, or displays\nthe smallest emotion at any sight whatever. She objects to Niagara that\n\"it's nothing but water,\" and considers that \"there is too much of\nthat.\"\n\nI suppose you have heard that I am going to act at the Montreal theatre\nwith the officers? Farce-books being scarce, and the choice consequently\nlimited, I have selected Keeley's part in \"Two o'Clock in the Morning.\"\nI wrote yesterday to Mitchell, the actor and manager at New York, to get\nand send me a comic wig, light flaxen, with a small whisker halfway down\nthe cheek; over this I mean to wear two night-caps, one with a tassel\nand one of flannel; a flannel wrapper, drab tights and slippers, will\ncomplete the costume.\n\nI am very sorry to hear that business is so flat, but the proverb says\nit never rains but it pours, and it may be remarked with equal truth\nupon the other side, that it never _don't_ rain but it holds up very\nmuch indeed. You will be busy again long before I come home, I have no\ndoubt.\n\nWe purpose leaving this on Wednesday morning. Give my love to Letitia\nand to mother, and always believe me, my dear Henry,\n\n                                                 Affectionately yours.",

I am decidedly\nopposed to it. I went there on the day I was in the chair, after much\nsolicitation; and being put into it, opened the proceedings by telling\nthe meeting that I approved of the design in theory, but in practice\nconsidered it hopeless. I may tell you--I did not tell them--that the\nnature of the meeting, and the character and position of many of the men\nattending it, cried \"Failure\" trumpet-tongued in my ears. To quote an\nexpression from Tennyson, I may say that if it were the best society in\nthe world, the grossness of some natures in it would have weight to drag\nit down.\n\nIn the wisdom of all you urge in the notes you have sent me, taking them\nas statements of theory, I entirely concur. But in practice, I feel sure\nthat the present publishing system cannot be overset until authors are\ndifferent men. The first step to be taken is to move as a body in the\nquestion of copyright, enforce the existing laws, and try to obtain\nbetter. For that purpose I hold that the authors and publishers must\nunite, as the wealth, business habits, and interest of that latter class\nare of great importance to such an end. The Longmans and Murray have\nbeen with me proposing such an association. That I shall support. But\nhaving seen the Cockspur Street Society, I am as well convinced of its\ninvincible hopelessness as if I saw it written by a celestial penman in\nthe Book of Fate.\n\n                                      My dear Sir,\n                                              Always faithfully yours.",

It is\nvery wise, and capital; written with the finest end of that iron pen of\nyours; witty, much needed, and full of truth. I vow to God that I think\nthe parrots of society are more intolerable and mischievous than its\nbirds of prey. If ever I destroy myself, it will be in the bitterness of\nhearing those infernal and damnably good old times extolled. Once, in a\nfit of madness, after having been to a public dinner which took place\njust as this Ministry came in, I wrote the parody I send you enclosed,\nfor Fonblanque. There is nothing in it but wrath; but that's wholesome,\nso I send it you.\n\nI am writing a little history of England for my boy, which I will send\nyou when it is printed for him, though your boys are too old to profit\nby it. It is curious that I have tried to impress upon him (writing, I\ndaresay, at the same moment with you) the exact spirit of your paper,\nfor I don't know what I should do if he were to get hold of any\nConservative or High Church notions; and the best way of guarding\nagainst any such horrible result is, I take it, to wring the parrots'\nnecks in his very cradle.\n\nOh Heaven, if you could have been with me at a hospital dinner last\nMonday! There were men there who made such speeches and expressed such\nsentiments as any moderately intelligent dustman would have blushed\nthrough his cindery bloom to have thought of. Sleek, slobbering,\nbow-paunched, over-fed, apoplectic, snorting cattle, and the auditory\nleaping up in their delight! I never saw such an illustration of the\npower of purse, or felt so degraded and debased by its contemplation,\nsince I have had eyes and ears. The absurdity of the thing was too\nhorrible to laugh at. It was perfectly overwhelming. But if I could have\npartaken it with anybody who would have felt it as you would have done,\nit would have had quite another aspect; or would at least, like a\n\"classic mask\" (oh d---- that word!) have had one funny side to relieve\nits dismal features.\n\nSupposing fifty families were to emigrate into the wilds of North\nAmerica--yours, mine, and forty-eight others--picked for their\nconcurrence of opinion on all important subjects and for their\nresolution to found a colony of common-sense, how soon would that devil,\nCant, present itself among them in one shape or other? The day they\nlanded, do you say, or the day after?\n\nThat is a great mistake (almost the only one I know) in the \"Arabian\nNights,\" when the princess restores people to their original beauty by\nsprinkling them with the golden water. It is quite clear that she must\nhave made monsters of them by such a christening as that.\n\n                                  My dear Jerrold,\n                                               Faithfully your Friend.",

There is also\nanother point, where Old Febrile, at the conclusion of his disclosure to\nSwig, rises and says: \"And now, Swig, tell me, have I acted well?\" And\nSwig says: \"Well, Mr. Febrile, have you ever acted ill?\" which will\ncarry off the piece.\n\nHerne Bay. Hum. I suppose it's no worse than any other place in this\nweather, but it is watery rather--isn't it? In my mind's eye, I have the\nsea in a perpetual state of smallpox; and the chalk running downhill\nlike town milk. But I know the comfort of getting to work in a fresh\nplace, and proposing pious projects to one's self, and having the more\nsubstantial advantage of going to bed early and getting up ditto, and\nwalking about alone. I should like to deprive you of the last-named\nhappiness, and to take a good long stroll, terminating in a\npublic-house, and whatever they chanced to have in it. But fine days are\nover, I think. The horrible misery of London in this weather, with not\neven a fire to make it cheerful, is hideous.\n\nBut I have my comedy to fly to. My only comfort! I walk up and down\nthe street at the back of the theatre every night, and peep in at\nthe green-room window, thinking of the time when \"Dick--ins\" will be\ncalled for by excited hundreds, and won't come till Mr. Webster\n(half Swig and half himself) shall enter from his dressing-room,\nand quelling the tempest with a smile, beseech that wizard, if he be\nin the house (here he looks up at my box), to accept the congratulations\nof the audience, and indulge them with a sight of the man who has got\nfive hundred pounds in money, and it's impossible to say how much in\nlaurel. Then I shall come forward, and bow once--twice--thrice--roars of\napprobation--Brayvo--brarvo--hooray--hoorar--hooroar--one cheer more;\nand asking Webster home to supper, shall declare eternal friendship for\nthat public-spirited individual.\n\nThey have not sent me the \"Illustrated Magazine.\" What do they mean by\nthat?

I see it all, and smell that\nextraordinary compound of odd scents peculiar to a theatre, which bursts\nupon me when I swing open the little door in the hall, accompanies me as\nI meet perspiring supers in the narrow passage, goes with me up the two\nsteps, crosses the stage, winds round the third entrance P.S. as I wind,\nand escorts me safely into your presence, where I find you unwinding\nsomething slowly round and round your chest, which is so long that no\nman can see the end of it.\n\nOh that you had been at Clarence Terrace on Nina's birthday! Good God,\nhow we missed you, talked of you, drank your health, and wondered what\nyou were doing! Perhaps you are Falkland enough (I swear I suspect you\nof it) to feel rather sore--just a little bit, you know, the merest\ntrifle in the world--on hearing that Mrs. Macready looked brilliant,\nblooming, young, and handsome, and that she danced a country dance with\nthe writer hereof (Acres to your Falkland) in a thorough spirit of\nbecoming good humour and enjoyment. Now you don't like to be told that?\nNor do you quite like to hear that Forster and I conjured bravely; that\na plum-pudding was produced from an empty saucepan, held over a blazing\nfire kindled in Stanfield's hat without damage to the lining; that a box\nof bran was changed into a live guinea-pig, which ran between my\ngodchild's feet, and was the cause of such a shrill uproar and clapping\nof hands that you might have heard it (and I daresay did) in America;\nthat three half-crowns being taken from Major Burns and put into a\ntumbler-glass before his eyes, did then and there give jingling answers\nto the questions asked of them by me, and knew where you were and what\nyou were doing, to the unspeakable admiration of the whole assembly.\nNeither do you quite like to be told that we are going to do it again\nnext Saturday, with the addition of demoniacal dresses from the\nmasquerade shop; nor that Mrs. Macready, for her gallant bearing always,\nand her best sort of best affection, is the best creature I know. Never\nmind; no man shall gag me, and those are my opinions.\n\nMy dear Macready, the lecturing proposition is not to be thought of. I\nhave not the slightest doubt or hesitation in giving you my most\nstrenuous and decided advice against it. Looking only to its effect at\nhome, I am immovable in my conviction that the impression it would\nproduce would be one of failure, and a reduction of yourself to the\nlevel of those who do the like here. To us who know the Boston names and\nhonour them, and who know Boston and like it (Boston is what I would\nhave the whole United States to be), the Boston requisition would be a\nvaluable document, of which you and your friends might be proud. But\nthose names are perfectly unknown to the public here, and would produce\nnot the least effect. The only thing known to the public here is, that\nthey ask (when I say \"they\" I mean the people) everybody to lecture. It\nis one of the things I have ridiculed in \"Chuzzlewit.\" Lecture you, and\nyou fall into the roll of Lardners, Vandenhoffs, Eltons, Knowleses,\nBuckinghams. You are off your pedestal, have flung away your glass\nslipper, and changed your triumphal coach into a seedy old pumpkin. I am\nquite sure of it, and cannot express my strong conviction in language of\nsufficient force.\n\n\"Puff-ridden!\" why to be sure they are. The nation is a miserable\nSindbad, and its boasted press the loathsome, foul old man upon his\nback, and yet they will tell you, and proclaim to the four winds for\nrepetition here, that they don't need their ignorant and brutal papers,\nas if the papers could exist if they didn't need them! Let any two of\nthese vagabonds, in any town you go to, take it into their heads to make\nyou an object of attack, or to direct the general attention elsewhere,\nand what avail those wonderful images of passion which you have been all\nyour life perfecting!\n\nI have sent you, to the charge of our trusty and well-beloved Colden, a\nlittle book I published on the 17th of December, and which has been a\nmost prodigious success--the greatest, I think, I have ever achieved. It\npleases me to think that it will bring you home for an hour or two, and\nI long to hear you have read it on some quiet morning. Do they allow you\nto be quiet, by-the-way? \"Some of our most fashionable people, sir,\"\ndenounced me awfully for liking to be alone sometimes.\n\nNow that we have turned Christmas, I feel as if your face were directed\nhomewards, Macready. The downhill part of the road is before us now, and\nwe shall travel on to midsummer at a dashing pace; and, please Heaven, I\nwill be at Liverpool when you come steaming up the Mersey, with that red\nfunnel smoking out unutterable things, and your heart much fuller than\nyour trunks, though something lighter! If I be not the first Englishman\nto shake hands with you on English ground, the man who gets before me\nwill be a brisk and active fellow, and even then need put his best leg\nforemost. So I warn Forster to keep in the rear, or he'll be blown.\n\nIf you shall have any leisure to project and put on paper the outline of\na scheme for opening any theatre on your return, upon a certain list\nsubscribed, and on certain understandings with the actors, it strikes me\nthat it would be wise to break ground while you are still away. Of\ncourse I need not say that I will see anybody or do anything--even to\nthe calling together of the actors--if you should ever deem it\ndesirable. My opinion is that our respected and valued friend Mr. ----\nwill stagger through another season, if he don't rot first. I understand\nhe is in a partial state of decomposition at this minute. He was very\nill, but got better. How is it that ---- always do get better, and\nstrong hearts are so easy to die?\n\nKate sends her tender love; so does Georgy, so does Charlie, so does\nMamey, so does Katey, so does Walter, so does the other one who is to be\nborn next week. Look homeward always, as we look abroad to you. God\nbless you, my dear Macready.\n\n                                        Ever your affectionate Friend.",

He had ordered dinner, and\nwe ate it pleasantly enough, and went to bed in good time. This morning,\nMr. Yates, the great man connected with the Institution (and a brother\nof Ashton Yates's), called. I went to look at it with him. It is an\nenormous place, and the tickets have been selling at two and even three\nguineas apiece. The lecture-room, in which the celebration is held, will\naccommodate over thirteen hundred people. It was being fitted with gas\nafter the manner of the ring at Astley's. I should think it an easy\nplace to speak in, being a semicircle with seats rising one above\nanother to the ceiling, and will have eight hundred ladies to-night, in\nfull dress. I am rayther shaky just now, but shall pull up, I have no\ndoubt. At dinner-time to-morrow you will receive, I hope, a facetious\ndocument hastily penned after I return to-night, telling you how it all\nwent off.\n\nWhen I came back here, I found Fanny and Hewett had picked me up just\nbefore. We all went off straight to the _Britannia_, which lay where she\ndid when we went on board. We went into the old little cabin and the\nladies' cabin, but Mrs. Bean had gone to Scotland, as the ship does not\nsail again before May. In the saloon we had some champagne and biscuits,\nand Hewett had set out upon the table a block of Boston ice, weighing\nfifty pounds. Scott, of the _Caledonia_, lunched with us--a very nice\nfellow. He saw Macready play Macbeth in Boston, and gave me a tremendous\naccount of the effect. Poor Burroughs, of the _George Washington_, died\non board, on his last passage home. His little wife was with him.\n\nHewett dines with us to-day, and I have procured him admission to-night.\nI am very sorry indeed (and so was he), that you didn't see the old\nship.

That the said speech\nwas enlivened by thirteen hundred persons, with frequent, vehement,\nuproarious, and deafening cheers, and to the best of this deponent's\nknowledge and belief, he, this deponent, did speak up like a man, and\ndid, to the best of his knowledge and belief, considerably distinguish\nhimself. That after the proceedings of the opening were over, and a vote\nof thanks was proposed to this deponent, he, this deponent, did again\ndistinguish himself, and that the cheering at that time, accompanied\nwith clapping of hands and stamping of feet, was in this deponent's case\nthundering and awful. And this deponent further saith, that his\nwhite-and-black or magpie waistcoat, did create a strong sensation, and\nthat during the hours of promenading, this deponent heard from persons\nsurrounding him such exclamations as, \"What is it! _Is_ it a waistcoat?\nNo, it's a shirt\"--and the like--all of which this deponent believes to\nhave been complimentary and gratifying; but this deponent further saith\nthat he is now going to supper, and wishes he may have an appetite to\neat it.\n\n                                                      CHARLES DICKENS.\n\n        Sworn before me, at the Adelphi }\n          Hotel, Liverpool, on the 26th }\n          of February, 1844.            }\n\n        S.

I don't exactly know what I have done\nfor my country in coming away from it; but I feel it is\nsomething--something great--something virtuous and heroic. Lofty\nemotions rise within me, when I see the sun set on the blue\nMediterranean. I am the limpet on the rock. My father's name is Turner\nand my boots are green.\n\nApropos of blue. In a certain picture, called \"The Serenade,\" you\npainted a sky. If you ever have occasion to paint the Mediterranean, let\nit be exactly of that colour. It lies before me now, as deeply and\nintensely blue. But no such colour is above me. Nothing like it. In the\nSouth of France--at Avignon, at Aix, at Marseilles--I saw deep blue\nskies (not _so_ deep though--oh Lord, no!), and also in America; but the\nsky above me is familiar to my sight. Is it heresy to say that I have\nseen its twin-brother shining through the window of Jack Straw's--that\ndown in Devonshire I have seen a better sky? I daresay it is; but like a\ngreat many other heresies, it is true.\n\nBut such green--green--green--as flutters in the vineyard down below the\nwindows, _that_ I never saw; nor yet such lilac, and such purple as\nfloat between me and the distant hills; nor yet--in anything--picture,\nbook, or verbal boredom--such awful, solemn, impenetrable blue, as is\nthat same sea. It has such an absorbing, silent, deep, profound effect,\nthat I can't help thinking it suggested the idea of Styx. It looks as if\na draught of it--only so much as you could scoop up on the beach, in the\nhollow of your hand--would wash out everything else, and make a great\nblue blank of your intellect.\n\nWhen the sun sets clearly, then, by Heaven, it is majestic! From any one\nof eleven windows here, or from a terrace overgrown with grapes, you may\nbehold the broad sea; villas, houses, mountains, forts, strewn with rose\nleaves--strewn with thorns--stifled in thorns! Dyed through and through\nand through. For a moment. No more. The sun is impatient and fierce,\nlike everything else in these parts, and goes down headlong. Run to\nfetch your hat--and it's night. Wink at the right time of black\nnight--and it's morning. Everything is in extremes. There is an insect\nhere (I forget its name, and Fletcher and Roche are both out) that\nchirps all day. There is one outside the window now. The chirp is very\nloud, something like a Brobdingnagian grasshopper. The creature is born\nto chirp--to progress in chirping--to chirp louder, louder, louder--till\nit gives one tremendous chirp, and bursts itself. That is its life and\ndeath. Everything \"is in a concatenation accordingly.\" The day gets\nbrighter, brighter, brighter, till it's night. The summer gets hotter,\nhotter, hotter, till it bursts. The fruit gets riper, riper, riper, till\nit tumbles down and rots.\n\nAsk me a question or two about fresco--will you be so good? All the\nhouses are painted in fresco hereabout--the outside walls I mean; the\nfronts, and backs, and sides--and all the colour has run into damp and\ngreen seediness, and the very design has struggled away into the\ncomponent atoms of the plaster. Sometimes (but not often) I can make out\na Virgin with a mildewed glory round her head; holding nothing, in an\nindiscernible lap, with invisible arms; and occasionally the leg or arms\nof a cherub, but it is very melancholy and dim. There are two old\nfresco-painted vases outside my own gate--one on either hand--which are\nso faint, that I never saw them till last night; and only then because I\nwas looking over the wall after a lizard, who had come upon me while I\nwas smoking a cigar above, and crawled over one of these embellishments\nto his retreat. There is a church here--the Church of the\nAnnunciation--which they are now (by \"they\" I mean certain noble\nfamilies) restoring at a vast expense, as a work of piety. It is a large\nchurch, with a great many little chapels in it, and a very high dome.\nEvery inch of this edifice is painted, and every design is set in a\ngreat gold frame or border elaborately wrought. You can imagine nothing\nso splendid. It is worth coming the whole distance to see. But every\nsort of splendour is in perpetual enactment through the means of these\nchurches. Gorgeous processions in the streets, illuminations of windows\non festa nights; lighting up of lamps and clustering of flowers before\nthe shrines of saints; all manner of show and display. The doors of the\nchurches stand wide open; and in this hot weather great red curtains\nflutter and wave in their palaces; and if you go and sit in one of these\nto get out of the sun, you see the queerest figures kneeling against\npillars, and the strangest people passing in and out, and vast streams\nof women in veils (they don't wear bonnets), with great fans in their\nhands, coming and going, that you are never tired of looking on. Except\nin the churches, you would suppose the city (at this time of year) to be\ndeserted, the people keep so close within doors. Indeed it is next to\nimpossible to go out into the heat. I have only been into Genoa twice\nmyself. We are deliciously cool here, by comparison; being high, and\nhaving the sea breeze. There is always some shade in the vineyard, too;\nand underneath the rocks on the sea-shore, so if I choose to saunter I\ncan do it easily, even in the hot time of the day. I am as lazy,\nhowever, as--as you are, and do little but eat and drink and read.\n\nAs I am going to transmit regular accounts of all sight-seeings and\njourneyings to Forster, who will show them to you, I will not bore you\nwith descriptions, however. I hardly think you allow enough for the\ngreat brightness and brilliancy of colour which is commonly achieved on\nthe Continent, in that same fresco painting. I saw some--by a French\nartist and his pupil--in progress at the cathedral at Avignon, which\nwas as bright and airy as anything can be,--nothing dull or dead about\nit; and I have observed quite fierce and glaring colours elsewhere.\n\nWe have a piano now (there was none in the house), and have fallen into\na pretty settled easy track. We breakfast about half-past nine or ten,\ndine about four, and go to bed about eleven. We are much courted by the\nvisiting people, of course, and I very much resort to my old habit of\nbolting from callers, and leaving their reception to Kate. Green figs I\nhave already learnt to like. Green almonds (we have them at dessert\nevery day) are the most delicious fruit in the world. And green lemons,\ncombined with some rare hollands that is to be got here, make prodigious\npunch, I assure you. You ought to come over, Mac; but I don't expect\nyou, though I am sure it would be a very good move for you. I have not\nthe smallest doubt of that. Fletcher has made a sketch of the house, and\nwill copy it in pen-and-ink for transmission to you in my next letter. I\nshall look out for a place in Genoa, between this and the winter time.\nIn the meantime, the people who come out here breathe delightedly, as if\nthey had got into another climate. Landing in the city, you would hardly\nsuppose it possible that there could be such an air within two miles.\n\nWrite to me as often as you can, like a dear good fellow, and rely upon\nthe punctuality of my correspondence. Losing you and Forster is like\nlosing my arms and legs, and dull and lame I am without you. But at\nBroadstairs next year, please God, when it is all over, I shall be very\nglad to have laid up such a store of recollections and improvement.\n\nI don't know what to do with Timber. He is as ill-adapted to the climate\nat this time of year as a suit of fur. I have had him made a lion dog;\nbut the fleas flock in such crowds into the hair he has left, that they\ndrive him nearly frantic, and renders it absolutely necessary that he\nshould be kept by himself. Of all the miserable hideous little frights\nyou ever saw, you never beheld such a devil. Apropos, as we were\ncrossing the Seine within two stages of Paris, Roche suddenly said to\nme, sitting by me on the box: \"The littel dog 'ave got a great lip!\" I\nwas thinking of things remote and very different, and couldn't\ncomprehend why any peculiarity in this feature on the part of the dog\nshould excite a man so much. As I was musing upon it, my ears were\nattracted by shouts of \"Helo! hola! Hi, hi, hi! Le voila! Regardez!\" and\nthe like. And looking down among the oxen--we were in the centre of a\nnumerous drove--I saw him, Timber, lying in the road, curled up--you\nknow his way--like a lobster, only not so stiff, yelping dismally in the\npain of his \"lip\" from the roof of the carriage; and between the aching\nof his bones, his horror of the oxen, and his dread of me (who he\nevidently took to be the immediate agent in and cause of the damage),\nsinging out to an extent which I believe to be perfectly unprecedented;\nwhile every Frenchman and French boy within sight roared for company. He\nwasn't hurt.\n\nKate and Georgina send their best loves; and the children add \"theirs.\"\nKatey, in particular, desires to be commended to \"Mr. Teese.\" She has a\nsore throat; from sitting in constant draughts, I suppose; but with that\nexception, we are all quite well. Ever believe me, my dear Mac,\n\n                                             Your affectionate Friend.",

Edward Tagart.]\n\n                       ALBARO, NEAR GENOA, _Friday, August 9th, 1844._\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nI find that if I wait to write you a long letter (which has been the\ncause of my procrastination in fulfilling my part of our agreement), I\nam likely to wait some time longer. And as I am very anxious to hear\nfrom you; not the less so, because if I hear of you through my brother,\nwho usually sees you once a week in my absence; I take pen in hand and\nstop a messenger who is going to Genoa. For my main object being to\nqualify myself for the receipt of a letter from you, I don't see why a\nten-line qualification is not as good as one of a hundred lines.\n\nYou told me it was possible that you and Mrs. Tagart might wander into\nthese latitudes in the autumn. I wish you would carry out that infant\nintention to the utmost. It would afford us the truest delight and\npleasure to receive you. If you come in October, you will find us in the\nPalazzo Peschiere, in Genoa, which is surrounded by a delicious garden,\nand is a most charming habitation in all respects. If you come in\nSeptember, you will find us less splendidly lodged, but on the margin of\nthe sea, and in the midst of vineyards. The climate is delightful even\nnow; the heat being not at all oppressive, except in the actual city,\nwhich is what the Americans would call considerable fiery, in the middle\nof the day. But the sea-breezes out here are refreshing and cool every\nday, and the bathing in the early morning is something more agreeable\nthan you can easily imagine. The orange trees of the Peschiere shall\ngive you their most fragrant salutations if you come to us at that\ntime, and we have a dozen spare beds in that house that I know of; to\nsay nothing of some vast chambers here and there with ancient iron\nchests in them, where Mrs. Tagart might enact Ginevra to perfection, and\nnever be found out. To prevent which, I will engage to watch her\nclosely, if she will only come and see us.\n\nThe flies are incredibly numerous just now. The unsightly blot a little\nhigher up was occasioned by a very fine one who fell into the inkstand,\nand came out, unexpectedly, on the nib of my pen. We are all quite well,\nthank Heaven, and had a very interesting journey here, of which, as well\nas of this place, I will not write a word, lest I should take the edge\noff those agreeable conversations with which we will beguile our walks.\n\nPray tell me about the presentation of the plate, and whether ---- was\nvery slow, or trotted at all, and if so, when. He is an excellent\ncreature, and I respect him very much, so I don't mind smiling when I\nthink of him as he appeared when addressing you and pointing to the\nplate, with his head a little on one side, and one of his eyes turned up\nlanguidly.\n\nAlso let me know exactly how you are travelling, and when, and all about\nit; that I may meet you with open arms on the threshold of the city, if\nhappily you bend your steps this way. You had better address me, \"Poste\nRestante, Genoa,\" as the Albaro postman gets drunk, and when he has lost\nletters, and is sober, sheds tears--which is affecting, but hardly\nsatisfactory.\n\nKate and her sister send their best regards to yourself, and Mrs. and\nMiss Tagart, and all your family. I heartily join them in all kind\nremembrances and good wishes. As the messenger has just looked in at the\ndoor, and shedding on me a balmy gale of onions, has protested against\nbeing detained any longer, I will only say (which is not at all\nnecessary) that I am ever,\n\n                                                     Faithfully yours.\n\nP.S.--There is a little to see here, in the church way, I assure you.",

When I think\nhow you are walking up and down London in that portly surtout, and can't\nreceive proposals from Dick to go to the theatre, I fall into a state\nbetween laughing and crying, and want some friendly back to smite.\n\"Je-im!\" \"Aye, aye, your honour,\" is in my ears every time I walk upon\nthe sea-shore here; and the number of expeditions I make into Cornwall\nin my sleep, the springs of Flys I break, the songs I sing, and the\nbowls of punch I drink, would soften a heart of stone.\n\nWe have had weather here, since five o'clock this morning, after your\nown heart. Suppose yourself the Admiral in \"Black-eyed Susan\" after the\nacquittal of William, and when it was possible to be on friendly terms\nwith him. I am T. P.[4] My trousers are very full at the ankles, my\nblack neckerchief is tied in the regular style, the name of my ship is\npainted round my glazed hat, I have a red waistcoat on, and the seams of\nmy blue jacket are \"paid\"--permit me to dig you in the ribs when I make\nuse of this nautical expression--with white. In my hand I hold the very\nbox connected with the story of Sandomingerbilly. I lift up my eyebrows\nas far as I can (on the T. P. model), take a quid from the box, screw\nthe lid on again (chewing at the same time, and looking pleasantly at\nthe pit), brush it with my right elbow, take up my right leg, scrape my\nright foot on the ground, hitch up my trousers, and in reply to a\nquestion of yours, namely, \"Indeed, what weather, William?\" I deliver\nmyself as follows:\n\n        Lord love your honour! Weather! Such weather as\n        would set all hands to the pumps aboard one of\n        your fresh-water cockboats, and set the purser\n        to his wits' ends to stow away, for the use of\n        the ship's company, the casks and casks full of\n        blue water as would come powering in over the\n        gunnel! The dirtiest night, your honour, as\n        ever you see 'atween Spithead at gun-fire and\n        the Bay of Biscay! The wind sou'-west, and your\n        house dead in the wind's eye; the breakers\n        running up high upon the rocky beads, the\n        light'us no more looking through the fog than\n        Davy Jones's sarser eye through the blue sky of\n        heaven in a calm, or the blue toplights of your\n        honour's lady cast down in a modest overhauling\n        of her catheads: avast! (_whistling_) my dear\n        eyes; here am I a-goin' head on to the breakers\n        (_bowing_).\n\n        _Admiral_ (_smiling_). No, William! I admire\n        plain speaking, as you know, and so does old\n        England, William, and old England's Queen. But\n        you were saying----\n\n        _William._ Aye, aye, your honour (_scratching\n        his head_). I've lost my reckoning. Damme!--I\n        ast pardon--but won't your honour throw a\n        hencoop or any old end of towline to a man as\n        is overboard?\n\n        _Admiral_ (_smiling still_). You were saying,\n        William, that the wind----\n\n        _William_ (_again cocking his leg, and slapping\n        the thighs very hard_). Avast heaving, your\n        honour! I see your honour's signal fluttering\n        in the breeze, without a glass. As I was\n        a-saying, your honour, the wind was blowin'\n        from the sou'-west, due sou'-west, your honour,\n        not a pint to larboard nor a pint to starboard;\n        the clouds a-gatherin' in the distance for all\n        the world like Beachy Head in a fog, the sea\n        a-rowling in, in heaps of foam, and making\n        higher than the mainyard arm, the craft\n        a-scuddin' by all taught and under storms'ils\n        for the harbour; not a blessed star a-twinklin'\n        out aloft--aloft, your honour, in the little\n        cherubs' native country--and the spray is\n        flying like the white foam from the Jolly's\n        lips when Poll of Portsea took him for a\n        tailor! (_laughs._)\n\n        _Admiral_ (_laughing also_). You have described\n        it well, William, and I thank you. But who are\n        these?\n\n        _Enter Supers in calico jackets to look like\n        cloth, some in brown holland petticoat-trousers\n        and big boots, all with very large buckles.\n        Last Super rolls on a cask, and pretends to\n        keep it. Other Supers apply their mugs to the\n        bunghole and drink, previously holding them\n        upside down._\n\n        _William_ (_after shaking hands with\n        everybody_). Who are these, your honour!\n        Messmates as staunch and true as ever broke\n        biscuit. Ain't you, my lads?\n\n        _All._ Aye, aye, William. That we are! that we\n        are!\n\n        _Admiral_ (_much affected_). Oh, England, what\n        wonder that----! But I will no longer detain\n        you from your sports, my humble friends\n        (ADMIRAL _speaks very low, and looks hard at\n        the orchestra, this being the cue for the\n        dance_)--from your sports, my humble friends.\n        Farewell!\n\n        _All._ Hurrah! hurrah! [_Exit_ ADMIRAL.\n\n        _Voice behind._ Suppose the dance, Mr.\n        Stanfield. Are you all ready? Go then!\n\nMy dear Stanfield, I wish you would come this way and see me in that\nPalazzo Peschiere! Was ever man so welcome as I would make you! What a\ntruly gentlemanly action it would be to bring Mrs. Stanfield and the\nbaby. And how Kate and her sister would wave pocket-handkerchiefs from\nthe wharf in joyful welcome! Ah, what a glorious proceeding!\n\nDo you know this place? Of course you do. I won't bore you with anything\nabout it, for I know Forster reads my letters to you; but what a place\nit is. The views from the hills here, and the immense variety of\nprospects of the sea, are as striking, I think, as such scenery can be.\nAbove all, the approach to Genoa, by sea from Marseilles, constitutes a\npicture which you ought to paint, for nobody else can ever do it!\nWilliam, you made that bridge at Avignon better than it is. Beautiful as\nit undoubtedly is, you made it fifty times better. And if I were\nMorrison, or one of that school (bless the dear fellows one and all!), I\nwouldn't stand it, but would insist on having another picture gratis, to\natone for the imposition.\n\nThe night is like a seaside night in England towards the end of\nSeptember. They say it is the prelude to clear weather. But the wind is\nroaring now, and the sea is raving, and the rain is driving down, as if\nthey had all set in for a real hearty picnic, and each had brought its\nown relations to the general festivity. I don't know whether you are\nacquainted with the coastguard and men in these parts? They are\nextremely civil fellows, of a very amiable manner and appearance, but\nthe most innocent men in matters you would suppose them to be well\nacquainted with, in virtue of their office, that I ever encountered. One\nof them asked me only yesterday, if it would take a year to get to\nEngland in a ship? Which I thought for a coastguardman was rather a tidy\nquestion. It would take a long time to catch a ship going there if he\nwere on board a pursuing cutter though. I think he would scarcely do it\nin twelve months, indeed.\n\nSo you were at Astley's t'other night. \"Now, Mr. Stickney, sir, what can\nI come for to go for to do for to bring for to fetch for to carry for\nyou, sir?\" \"He, he, he! Oh, I say, sir!\" \"Well, sir?\" \"Miss Woolford\nknows me, sir. She laughed at me!\" I see him run away after this; not on\nhis feet, but on his knees and the calves of his legs alternately; and\nthat smell of sawdusty horses, which was never in any other place in the\nworld, salutes my nose with painful distinctness. What do you think of\nmy suddenly finding myself a swimmer? But I have really made the\ndiscovery, and skim about a little blue bay just below the town here,\nlike a fish in high spirits. I hope to preserve my bathing-dress for\nyour inspection and approval, or possibly to enrich your collection of\nItalian costumes on my return. Do you recollect Yarnold in \"Masaniello\"?\nI fear that I, unintentionally, \"dress at him,\" before plunging into the\nsea. I enhanced the likeness very much, last Friday morning, by singing\na barcarole on the rocks. I was a trifle too flesh-coloured (the stage\nknowing no medium between bright salmon and dirty yellow), but apart\nfrom that defect, not badly made up by any means. When you write to me,\nmy dear Stanny, as I hope you will soon, address Poste Restante, Genoa.\nI remain out here until the end of September, and send in for my letters\ndaily. There is a postman for this place, but he gets drunk and loses\nthe letters; after which he calls to say so, and to fall upon his knees.\nAbout three weeks ago I caught him at a wine-shop near here, playing\nbowls in the garden. It was then about five o'clock in the afternoon,\nand he had been airing a newspaper addressed to me, since nine o'clock\nin the morning.\n\nKate and Georgina unite with me in most cordial remembrances to Mrs. and\nMiss Stanfield, and to all the children. They particularise all sorts of\nmessages, but I tell them that they had better write themselves if they\nwant to send any. Though I don't know that this writing would end in the\nsafe deliverance of the commodities after all; for when I began this\nletter, I meant to give utterance to all kinds of heartiness, my dear\nStanfield; and I come to the end of it without having said anything more\nthan that I am--which is new to you--under every circumstance and\neverywhere,\n\n                                        Your most affectionate Friend.",

I should have redeemed the pledge I\ngave you in this regard long since, but occupation at one time, and\nabsence from pen and ink at another, have prevented me.\n\nForster has told you, or will tell you, that I very much wish you to\nhear my little Christmas book; and I hope you will meet me, at his\nbidding, in Lincoln's Inn Fields. I have tried to strike a blow upon\nthat part of the brass countenance of wicked Cant, when such a\ncompliment is sorely needed at this time, and I trust that the result of\nmy training is at least the exhibition of a strong desire to make it a\nstaggerer. If _you_ should think at the end of the four rounds (there\nare no more) that the said Cant, in the language of _Bell's Life_,\n\"comes up piping,\" I shall be very much the better for it.\n\nI am now on my way to Milan; and from thence (after a day or two's rest)\nI mean to come to England by the grandest Alpine pass that the snow may\nleave open. You know this place as famous of yore for fiddles. I don't\nsee any here now. But there is a whole street of coppersmiths not far\nfrom this inn; and they throb so d----ably and fitfully, that I thought\nI had a palpitation of the heart after dinner just now, and seldom was\nmore relieved than when I found the noise to be none of mine.\n\nI was rather shocked yesterday (I am not strong in geographical details)\nto find that Romeo was only banished twenty-five miles. That is the\ndistance between Mantua and Verona. The latter is a quaint old place,\nwith great houses in it that are now solitary and shut up--exactly the\nplace it ought to be. The former has a great many apothecaries in it at\nthis moment, who could play that part to the life. For of all the\nstagnant ponds I ever beheld, it is the greenest and weediest. I went to\nsee the old palace of the Capulets, which is still distinguished by\ntheir cognizance (a hat carved in stone on the courtyard wall). It is a\nmiserable inn. The court was full of crazy coaches, carts, geese, and\npigs, and was ankle-deep in mud and dung. The garden is walled off and\nbuilt out. There was nothing to connect it with its old inhabitants, and\na very unsentimental lady at the kitchen door. The Montagues used to\nlive some two or three miles off in the country. It does not appear\nquite clear whether they ever inhabited Verona itself. But there is a\nvillage bearing their name to this day, and traditions of the quarrels\nbetween the two families are still as nearly alive as anything can be,\nin such a drowsy neighbourhood.\n\nIt was very hearty and good of you, Jerrold, to make that affectionate\nmention of the \"Carol\" in _Punch_, and I assure you it was not lost on\nthe distant object of your manly regard, but touched him as you wished\nand meant it should. I wish we had not lost so much time in improving\nour personal knowledge of each other. But I have so steadily read you,\nand so selfishly gratified myself in always expressing the admiration\nwith which your gallant truths inspired me, that I must not call it time\nlost, either.\n\nYou rather entertained a notion, once, of coming to see me at Genoa. I\nshall return straight, on the 9th of December, limiting my stay in town\nto one week. Now couldn't you come back with me? The journey, that way,\nis very cheap, costing little more than twelve pounds; and I am sure the\ngratification to you would be high. I am lodged in quite a wonderful\nplace, and would put you in a painted room, as big as a church and much\nmore comfortable. There are pens and ink upon the premises; orange\ntrees, gardens, battledores and shuttlecocks, rousing wood-fires for\nevenings, and a welcome worth having.\n\nCome! Letter from a gentleman in Italy to Bradbury and Evans in London.\nLetter from a gentleman in a country gone to sleep to a gentleman in a\ncountry that would go to sleep too, and never wake again, if some people\nhad their way. You can work in Genoa. The house is used to it. It is\nexactly a week's post. Have that portmanteau looked to, and when we\nmeet, say, \"I am coming.\"\n\nI have never in my life been so struck by any place as by Venice. It is\n_the_ wonder of the world. Dreamy, beautiful, inconsistent, impossible,\nwicked, shadowy, d----able old place. I entered it by night, and the\nsensation of that night and the bright morning that followed is a part\nof me for the rest of my existence. And, oh God! the cells below the\nwater, underneath the Bridge of Sighs; the nook where the monk came at\nmidnight to confess the political offender; the bench where he was\nstrangled; the deadly little vault in which they tied him in a sack, and\nthe stealthy crouching little door through which they hurried him into a\nboat, and bore him away to sink him where no fisherman dare cast his\nnet--all shown by torches that blink and wink, as if they were ashamed\nto look upon the gloomy theatre of sad horrors; past and gone as they\nare, these things stir a man's blood, like a great wrong or passion of\nthe instant. And with these in their minds, and with a museum there,\nhaving a chamber full of such frightful instruments of torture as the\ndevil in a brain fever could scarcely invent, there are hundreds of\nparrots, who will declaim to you in speech and print, by the hour\ntogether, on the degeneracy of the times in which a railroad is building\nacross the water at Venice; instead of going down on their knees, the\ndrivellers, and thanking Heaven that they live in a time when iron makes\nroads, instead of prison bars and engines for driving screws into the\nskulls of innocent men. Before God, I could almost turn bloody-minded,\nand shoot the parrots of our island with as little compunction as\nRobinson Crusoe shot the parrots in his.\n\nI have not been in bed, these ten days, after five in the morning, and\nhave been, travelling many hours every day. If this be the cause of my\ninflicting a very stupid and sleepy letter on you, my dear Jerrold, I\nhope it will be a kind of signal at the same time, of my wish to hail\nyou lovingly even from this sleepy and unpromising state. And believe me\nas I am,\n\n                                       Always your Friend and Admirer.",

I have worn myself to death in the month I have been at\nwork. None of my usual reliefs have been at hand; I have not been able\nto divest myself of the story--have suffered very much in my sleep in\nconsequence--and am so shaken by such work in this trying climate, that\nI am as nervous as a man who is dying of drink, and as haggard as a\nmurderer.\n\nI believe I have written a tremendous book, and knocked the \"Carol\" out\nof the field. It will make a great uproar, I have no doubt.\n\nI leave here to-morrow for Venice and many other places; and I shall\ncertainly come to London to see my proofs, coming by new ground all the\nway, cutting through the snow in the valleys of Switzerland, and\nplunging through the mountains in the dead of winter. I would accept\nyour hearty offer with right goodwill, but my visit being one of\nbusiness and consultation, I see impediments in the way, and\ninsurmountable reasons for not doing so. Therefore, I shall go to an\nhotel in Covent Garden, where they know me very well, and with the\nlandlord of which I have already communicated. My orders are not upon a\nmighty scale, extending no further than a good bedroom and a cold\nshower-bath.\n\nBradbury and Evans are going at it, ding-dong, and are wild with\nexcitement. All news on that subject (and on every other) I must defer\ntill I see you. That will be immediately after I arrive, of course. Most\nlikely on Monday, 2nd December.\n\nKate and her sister (who send their best regards) and all the children\nare as well as possible. The house is _perfect_; the servants are as\nquiet and well-behaved as at home, which very rarely happens here, and\nRoche is my right hand. There never was such a fellow.\n\nWe have now got carpets down--burn fires at night--draw the curtains,\nand are quite wintry. We have a box at the opera, which, is close by\n(for nothing), and sit there when we please, as in our own drawing-room.\nThere have been three fine days in four weeks. On every other the water\nhas been falling down in one continual sheet, and it has been thundering\nand lightening every day and night.\n\nMy hand shakes in that feverish and horrible manner that I can hardly\nhold a pen.

We left\nGenoa, as you know, soon after five on the evening of my departure; and\nin company with the lady whom you saw, and the dog whom I don't think\nyou did see, travelled all night at the rate of four miles an hour over\nbad roads, without the least refreshment until daybreak, when the brave\nand myself escaped into a miserable caffe while they were changing\nhorses, and got a cup of that drink hot. That same day, a few hours\nafterwards, between ten and eleven, we came to (I hope) the d----dest\ninn in the world, where, in a vast chamber, rendered still more desolate\nby the presence of a most offensive specimen of what D'Israeli calls the\nMosaic Arab (who had a beautiful girl with him), I regaled upon a\nbreakfast, almost as cold, and damp, and cheerless, as myself. Then, in\nanother coach, much smaller than a small Fly, I was packed up with an\nold padre, a young Jesuit, a provincial avvocato, a private gentleman\nwith a very red nose and a very wet brown umbrella, and the brave C. and\nI went on again at the same pace through the mud and rain until four in\nthe afternoon, when there was a place in the coupe (two indeed), which I\ntook, holding that select compartment in company with a very ugly but\nvery agreeable Tuscan \"gent,\" who said \"_gia_\" instead of \"_si_,\" and\nrung some other changes in this changing language, but with whom I got\non very well, being extremely conversational. We were bound, as you know\nperhaps, for Piacenza, but it was discovered that we couldn't get to\nPiacenza, and about ten o'clock at night we halted at a place called\nStradella, where the inn was a series of queer galleries open to the\nnight, with a great courtyard full of waggons and horses, and\n\"_velociferi_,\" and what not in the centre. It was bitter cold and very\nwet, and we all walked into a bare room (mine!) with two immensely broad\nbeds on two deal dining-tables, a third great empty table, the usual\nwashing-stand tripod, with a slop-basin on it, and two chairs. And then\nwe walked up and down for three-quarters of an hour or so, while dinner,\nor supper, or whatever it was, was getting ready. This was set forth (by\nway of variety) in the old priest's bedroom, which had two more\nimmensely broad beds on two more deal dining-tables in it. The first\ndish was a cabbage boiled in a great quantity of rice and hot water, the\nwhole flavoured with cheese. I was so cold that I thought it\ncomfortable, and so hungry that a bit of cabbage, when I found such a\nthing floating my way, charmed me. After that we had a dish of very\nlittle pieces of pork, fried with pigs' kidneys; after that a fowl;\nafter that something very red and stringy, which I think was veal; and\nafter that two tiny little new-born-baby-looking turkeys, very red and\nvery swollen. Fruit, of course, to wind up, and garlic in one shape or\nanother in every course. I made three jokes at supper (to the immense\ndelight of the company), and retired early. The brave brought in a bush\nor two and made a fire, and after that a glass of screeching hot brandy\nand water; that bottle of his being full of brandy. I drank it at my\nleisure, undressed before the fire, and went into one of the beds. The\nbrave reappeared about an hour afterwards and went into the other;\npreviously tying a pocket-handkerchief round and round his head in a\nstrange fashion, and giving utterance to the sentiment with which this\nletter begins. At five this morning we resumed our journey, still\nthrough mud and rain, and at about eleven arrived at Piacenza; where we\nfellow-passengers took leave of one another in the most affectionate\nmanner. As there was no coach on till six at night, and as it was a very\ngrim, despondent sort of place, and as I had had enough of diligences\nfor one while, I posted forward here in the strangest carriages ever\nbeheld, which we changed when we changed horses. We arrived here before\nsix. The hotel is quite French. I have dined very well in my own room on\nthe second floor; and it has two beds in it, screened off from the room\nby drapery. I only use one to-night, and that is already made.\n\nI purpose posting on to Bologna, if I can arrange it, at twelve\nto-morrow; seeing the sights here first.\n\nIt is dull work this travelling alone. My only comfort is in motion. I\nlook forward with a sort of shudder to Sunday, when I shall have a day\nto myself in Bologna; and I think I must deliver my letters in Venice in\nsheer desperation. Never did anybody want a companion after dinner so\nmuch as I do.\n\nThere has been music on the landing outside my door to-night. Two\nviolins and a violoncello. One of the violins played a solo, and the\nothers struck in as an orchestra does now and then, very well. Then he\ncame in with a small tin platter. \"Bella musica,\" said I. \"Bellissima\nmusica, signore. Mi piace moltissimo. Sono felice, signoro,\" said he. I\ngave him a franc. \"O moltissimo generoso. Tanto generoso signore!\"\n\nIt was a joke to laugh at when I was learning, but I swear unless I\ncould stagger on, Zoppa-wise, with the people, I verily believe I should\nhave turned back this morning.\n\nIn all other respects I think the entire change has done me undoubted\nservice already. I am free of the book, and am red-faced; and feel\nmarvellously disposed to sleep.\n\nSo for all the straggling qualities of this straggling letter, want of\nsleep must be responsible. Give my best love to Georgy, and my paternal\nblessing to\n\n        Mamey,\n        Katey,\n        Charley,\n        Wally,\n        and\n        Chickenstalker.\n\nP.S.--Get things in their places. I can't bear to picture them\notherwise.\n\nP.P.S.--I think I saw Roche sleeping with his head on the lady's\nshoulder, in the coach. I couldn't swear it, and the light was\ndeceptive.

And I am happy to say that I have\nthe best and fullest intentions of sleeping in the bed, having arrived\nhere at half-past four this afternoon, without any cessation of\ntravelling, night or day, since I parted from Mr. Bairr's cheap\nfirewood.\n\nThe Alps appeared in sight very soon after we left Milan--by eight or\nnine o'clock in the morning; and the brave C. was so far wrong in his\ncalculations that we began the ascent of the Simplon that same night,\nwhile you were travelling (as I would I were) towards the Peschiere.\nMost favourable state of circumstances for journeying up that tremendous\npass! The brightest moon I ever saw, all night, and daybreak on the\nsummit. The glory of which, making great wastes of snow a rosy red,\nexceeds all telling. We _sledged_ through the snow on the summit for two\nhours or so. The weather was perfectly fair and bright, and there was\nneither difficulty nor danger--except the danger that there always must\nbe, in such a place, of a horse stumbling on the brink of an\nimmeasurable precipice. In which case no piece of the unfortunate\ntraveller would be left large enough to tell his story in dumb show. You\nmay imagine something of the rugged grandeur of such a scene as this\ngreat passage of these great mountains, and indeed Glencoe, well\nsprinkled with snow, would be very like the ascent. But the top itself,\nso wild, and bleak, and lonely, is a thing by itself, and not to be\nlikened to any other sight. The cold was piercing; the north wind high\nand boisterous; and when it came driving in our faces, bringing a sharp\nshower of little points of snow and piercing it into our very blood, it\nreally was, what it is often said to be, \"cutting\"--with a very sharp\nedge too. There are houses of refuge here--bleak, solitary places--for\ntravellers overtaken by the snow to hurry to, as an escape from death;\nand one great house, called the Hospital, kept by monks, where wayfarers\nget supper and bed for nothing. We saw some coming out and pursuing\ntheir journey. If all monks devoted themselves to such uses, I should\nhave little fault to find with them.\n\nThe cold in Switzerland, since, has been something quite indescribable.\nMy eyes are tingling to-night as one may suppose cymbals to tingle when\nthey have been lustily played. It is positive pain to me to write. The\ngreat organ which I was to have had \"pleasure in hearing\" don't play on\na Sunday, at which the brave is inconsolable. But the town is\npicturesque and quaint, and worth seeing. And this inn (with a German\nbedstead in it about the size and shape of a baby's linen-basket) is\nperfectly clean and comfortable. Butter is so cheap hereabouts that they\nbring you a great mass like the squab of a sofa for tea. And of honey,\nwhich is most delicious, they set before you a proportionate allowance.\nWe start to-morrow morning at six for Strasburg, and from that town, or\nthe next halting-place on the Rhine, I will report progress, if it be\nonly in half-a-dozen words.\n\nI am anxious to hear that you reached Genoa quite comfortably, and shall\nlook forward with impatience to that letter which you are to indite with\nso much care and pains next Monday. My best love to Georgy, and to\nCharley, and Mamey, and Katey, and Wally, and Chickenstalker. I have\ntreated myself to a new travelling-cap to-night (my old one being too\nthin), and it is rather a prodigious affair I flatter myself.\n\nSwiss towns, and mountains, and the Lake of Geneva, and the famous\nsuspension bridge at this place, and a great many other objects (with a\nvery low thermometer conspicuous among them), are dancing up and down\nme, strangely. But I am quite collected enough, notwithstanding, to have\nstill a very distinct idea that this hornpipe travelling is\nuncomfortable, and that I would gladly start for my palazzo out of hand\nwithout any previous rest, stupid as I am and much as I want it.\n\n                                   Ever, my dear love,\n                                                 Affectionately yours.\n\nP.S.--I hope the dancing lessons will be a success.

But\nthe weather being foggy, and the season quite over, they could not\ninsure me getting on for certain beyond Mayence, or our not being\ndetained by unpropitious weather. Therefore I resolved (the malle poste\nbeing full) to take the diligence hither next day in the afternoon. I\narrived here at half-past five to-night, after fifty hours of it in a\nFrench coach. I was so beastly dirty when I got to this house, that I\nhad quite lost all sense of my identity, and if anybody had said, \"Are\nyou Charles Dickens?\" I should have unblushingly answered, \"No; I never\nheard of him.\" A good wash, and a good dress, and a good dinner have\nrevived me, however; and I can report of this house, concerning which\nthe brave was so anxious when we were here before, that it is the best I\never was in. My little apartment, consisting of three rooms and other\nconveniences, is a perfect curiosity of completeness. You never saw such\na charming little baby-house. It is infinitely smaller than those first\nrooms we had at Meurice's, but for elegance, compactness, comfort, and\nquietude, exceeds anything I ever met with at an inn.\n\nThe moment I arrived here, I enquired, of course, after Macready. They\nsaid the English theatre had not begun yet, that they thought he was at\nMeurice's, where they knew some members of the company to be. I\ninstantly despatched the porter with a note to say that if he were\nthere, I would come round and hug him, as soon as I was clean. They\nreferred the porter to the Hotel Brighton. He came back and told me that\nthe answer there was: \"M. Macready's rooms were engaged, but he had not\narrived. He was expected to-night!\" If we meet to-night, I will add a\npostscript. Wouldn't it be odd if we met upon the road between this and\nBoulogne to-morrow?\n\nI mean, as a recompense for my late sufferings, to get a\nhackney-carriage if I can and post that journey, starting from here at\neight to-morrow morning, getting to Boulogne sufficiently early next\nmorning to cross at once, and dining with Forster that same day--to wit,\nSaturday. I have notions of taking you with me on my next journey (if\nyou would like to go), and arranging for Georgy to come to us by\nsteamer--under the protection of the English captain, for instance--to\nNaples; there I would top and cap all our walks by taking her up to the\ncrater of Vesuvius with me. But this is dependent on her ability to be\nperfectly happy for a fortnight or so in our stately palace with the\nchildren, and such foreign aid as the Simpsons. For I love her too\ndearly to think of any project which would involve her being\nuncomfortable for that space of time.\n\nYou can think this over, and talk it over; and I will join you in doing\nso, please God, when I return to our Italian bowers, which I shall be\nheartily glad to do.\n\nThey tell us that the landlord of this house, going to London some week\nor so ago, was detained at Boulogne two days by a high sea, in which the\npacket could not put out. So I hope there is the greater chance of no\nsuch bedevilment happening to me.\n\nParis is better than ever. Oh dear, how grand it was when I came through\nit in that caravan to-night! I hope we shall be very hearty here, and\nable to say with Wally, \"Han't it plassant!\"\n\nLove to Charley, Mamey, Katey, Wally, and Chickenstalker. The\nlast-named, I take it for granted, is indeed prodigious.\n\nBest love to Georgy.\n\n                                Ever, my dearest Kate,\n                                                 Affectionately yours.\n\nP.S.--I have been round to Macready's hotel; it is now past ten, and he\nhas not arrived, nor does it seem at all certain that he seriously\nintended to arrive to-night.

It is no more like Italian than English is to Welsh.\nAnd as they don't say half of what they mean, but make a wink or a kick\nstand for a whole sentence, it's a marvel to me how they comprehend each\nother. At Rome they speak beautiful Italian (I am pretty strong at that,\nI believe); but they are worse here than in Genoa, which I had\npreviously thought impossible.\n\nIt is a fine place, but nothing like so beautiful as people make it out\nto be. The famous bay is, to my thinking, as a piece of scenery,\nimmeasurably inferior to the Bay of Genoa, which is the most lovely\nthing I have ever seen. The city, in like manner, will bear no\ncomparison with Genoa. But there is none in Italy that will, except\nVenice. As to houses, there is no palace like the Peschiere for\narchitecture, situation, gardens, or rooms. It is a great triumph to me,\ntoo, to find how cheap it is. At Rome, the English people live in dirty\nlittle fourth, fifth, and sixth floors, with not one room as large as\nyour own drawing-room, and pay, commonly, seven or eight pounds a week.\n\nI was a week in Rome on my way here, and saw the Carnival, which is\nperfectly delirious, and a great scene for a description. All the\nancient part of Rome is wonderful and impressive in the extreme. Far\nbeyond the possibility of exaggeration as to the modern part, it might\nbe anywhere or anything--Paris, Nice, Boulogne, Calais, or one of a\nthousand other places.\n\nThe weather is so atrocious (rain, snow, wind, darkness, hail, and cold)\nthat I can't get over into Sicily. But I don't care very much about it,\nas I have planned out ten days of excursion into the neighbouring\ncountry. One thing of course--the ascent of Vesuvius, Herculaneum and\nPompeii, the two cities which were covered by its melted ashes, and dug\nout in the first instance accidentally, are more full of interest and\nwonder than it is possible to imagine. I have heard of some ancient\ntombs (quite unknown to travellers) dug in the bowels of the earth, and\nextending for some miles underground. They are near a place called\nViterbo, on the way from Rome to Florence. I shall lay in a small stock\nof torches, etc., and explore them when I leave Rome. I return there on\nthe 1st of March, and shall stay there nearly a month.\n\nSaturday, February 22nd.--Since I left off as above, I have been away on\nan excursion of three days. Yesterday evening, at four o'clock, we began\n(a small party of six) the ascent of Mount Vesuvius, with six\nsaddle-horses, an armed soldier for a guard, and twenty-two guides. The\nlatter rendered necessary by the severity of the weather, which is\ngreater than has been known for twenty years, and has covered the\nprecipitous part of the mountain with deep snow, the surface of which is\nglazed with one smooth sheet of ice from the top of the cone to the\nbottom. By starting at that hour I intended to get the sunset about\nhalfway up, and night at the top, where the fire is raging. It was an\ninexpressibly lovely night without a cloud; and when the day was quite\ngone, the moon (within a few hours of the full) came proudly up, showing\nthe sea, and the Bay of Naples, and the whole country, in such majesty\nas no words can express. We rode to the beginning of the snow and then\ndismounted. Catherine and Georgina were put into two litters, just\nchairs with poles, like those in use in England on the 5th of November;\nand a fat Englishman, who was of the party, was hoisted into a third,\nborne by eight men. I was accommodated with a tough stick, and we began\nto plough our way up. The ascent was as steep as this line /--very\nnearly perpendicular. We were all tumbling at every stop; and looking up\nand seeing the people in advance tumbling over one's very head, and\nlooking down and seeing hundreds of feet of smooth ice below, was, I\nmust confess, anything but agreeable. However, I knew there was little\nchance of another clear night before I leave this, and gave the word to\nget up, somehow or other. So on we went, winding a little now and then,\nor we should not have got on at all. By prodigious exertions we passed\nthe region of snow, and came into that of fire--desolate and awful, you\nmay well suppose. It was like working one's way through a dry waterfall,\nwith every mass of stone burnt and charred into enormous cinders, and\nsmoke and sulphur bursting out of every chink and crevice, so that it\nwas difficult to breathe. High before us, bursting out of a hill at the\ntop of the mountain, shaped like this [HW: A], the fire was pouring out,\nreddening the night with flames, blackening it with smoke, and spotting\nit with red-hot stones and cinders that fell down again in showers. At\nevery step everybody fell, now into a hot chink, now into a bed of\nashes, now over a mass of cindered iron; and the confusion in the\ndarkness (for the smoke obscured the moon in this part), and the\nquarrelling and shouting and roaring of the guides, and the waiting\nevery now and then for somebody who was not to be found, and was\nsupposed to have stumbled into some pit or other, made such a scene of\nit as I can give you no idea of. My ladies were now on foot, of course;\nbut we dragged them on as well as we could (they were thorough game, and\ndidn't make the least complaint), until we got to the foot of that\ntopmost hill I have drawn so beautifully. Here we all stopped; but the\nhead guide, an English gentleman of the name of Le Gros--who has been\nhere many years, and has been up the mountain a hundred times--and your\nhumble servant, resolved (like jackasses) to climb that hill to the\nbrink, and look down into the crater itself. You may form some notion of\nwhat is going on inside it, when I tell you that it is a hundred feet\nhigher than it was six weeks ago. The sensation of struggling up it,\nchoked with the fire and smoke, and feeling at every step as if the\ncrust of ground between one's feet and the gulf of fire would crumble in\nand swallow one up (which is the real danger), I shall remember for some\nlittle time, I think. But we did it. We looked down into the flaming\nbowels of the mountain and came back again, alight in half-a-dozen\nplaces, and burnt from head to foot. You never saw such devils. And _I_\nnever saw anything so awful and terrible.\n\nRoche had been tearing his hair like a madman, and crying that we should\nall three be killed, which made the rest of the company very\ncomfortable, as you may suppose. But we had some wine in a basket, and\nall swallowed a little of that and a great deal of sulphur before we\nbegan to descend. The usual way, after the fiery part is past--you will\nunderstand that to be all the flat top of the mountain, in the centre\nof which, again, rises the little hill I have drawn--is to slide down\nthe ashes, which, slipping from under you, make a gradually increasing\nledge under your feet, and prevent your going too fast. But when we came\nto this steep place last night, we found nothing there but one smooth\nsolid sheet of ice. The only way to get down was for the guides to make\na chain, holding by each other's hands, and beat a narrow track in it\ninto the snow below with their sticks. My two unfortunate ladies were\ntaken out of their litters again, with half-a-dozen men hanging on to\neach, to prevent their falling forward; and we began to descend this\nway. It was like a tremendous dream. It was impossible to stand, and the\nonly way to prevent oneself from going sheer down the precipice, every\ntime one fell, was to drive one's stick into one of the holes the guides\nhad made, and hold on by that. Nobody could pick one up, or stop one, or\nrender one the least assistance. Now, conceive my horror, when this Mr.\nLe Gros I have mentioned, being on one side of Georgina and I on the\nother, suddenly staggers away from the narrow path on to the smooth ice,\ngives us a jerk, lets go, and plunges headforemost down the smooth ice\ninto the black night, five hundred feet below! Almost at the same\ninstant, a man far behind, carrying a light basket on his head with some\nof our spare cloaks in it, misses his footing and rolls down in another\nplace; and after him, rolling over and over like a black bundle, goes a\nboy, shrieking as nobody but an Italian can shriek, until the breath is\ntumbled out of him.\n\nThe Englishman is in bed to-day, terribly bruised but without any broken\nbones. He was insensible at first and a mere heap of rags; but we got\nhim before the fire, in a little hermitage there is halfway down, and he\nso far recovered as to be able to take some supper, which was waiting\nfor us there. The boy was brought in with his head tied up in a bloody\ncloth, about half an hour after the rest of us were assembled. And the\nman who had had the basket was not found when we left the mountain at\nmidnight. What became of the cloaks (mine was among them) I know as\nlittle. My ladies' clothes were so torn off their backs that they would\nnot have been decent, if there could have been any thought of such\nthings at such a time. And when we got down to the guides' house, we\nfound a French surgeon (one of another party who had been up before us)\nlying on a bed in a stable, with God knows what horrible breakage about\nhim, but suffering acutely and looking like death. A pretty unusual trip\nfor a pleasure expedition, I think!\n\nI am rather stiff to-day but am quite unhurt, except a slight scrape on\nmy right hand. My clothes are burnt to pieces. My ladies are the wonder\nof Naples, and everybody is open-mouthed.\n\nAddress me as usual. All letters are forwarded. The children well and\nhappy. Best regards.\n\n                                                      Ever faithfully.",

But after going carefully through the school, a question\nwould arise in my mind whether the system--a perfectly admirable one;\nthe only recognition of education as a broad system of moral and\nintellectual philosophy, that I have ever seen in practice--do not\nrequire so much preparation and progress in the mind of the boy, as that\nhe shall have come there younger and less advanced than Willy; or at all\nevents without that very different sort of school experience which he\nmust have acquired at Brighton. I have no warrant for this doubt, beyond\na vague uneasiness suggesting a suspicion of its great probability. On\nsuch slight ground I would not hint it to anyone but you, who I know\nwill give it its due weight, and no more and no less.\n\nI have the paper setting forth the nature of the higher classical\nstudies, and the books they read. It is the usual course, and includes\nthe great books in Greek and Latin. They have a miscellaneous library,\nunder the management of the boys themselves, of some five or six\nthousand volumes, and every means of study and recreation, and every\ninducement to self-reliance and self-exertion that can easily be\nimagined.

Then that purse which I could never keep shut in my life makes\nmouths at me, saying, \"See how empty I am.\" Then I fill it, and it looks\nvery rich indeed.\n\nI think the best way is to say, that if you think you can do him any\n_permanent_ good with five pounds (that is, get him home again) I will\ngive you the money. But I should be very much indisposed to give it him,\nmerely to linger on here about town for a little time and then be hard\nup again.\n\nAs to employment, I do in my soul believe that if I were Lord Chancellor\nof England, I should have been aground long ago, for the patronage of a\nmessenger's place.\n\nSay all that is civil for me to the proprietor of _The Illustrated\nLondon News_, who really seems to be very liberal. \"Other engagements,\"\netc. etc., \"prevent me from entertaining,\" etc. etc.\n\n                                                Faithfully yours ever.",

WILLS,\n\nI assure you I am very truly and unaffectedly sensible of your earnest\nfriendliness, and in proof of my feeling its worth I shall\nunhesitatingly trouble you sometimes, in the fullest reliance on your\nmeaning what you say. The letter from Nelson Square is a very manly and\ntouching one. But I am more helpless in such a case as that than in any\nother, having really fewer means of helping such a gentleman to\nemployment than I have of firing off the guns in the Tower. Such,\nappeals come to me here in scores upon scores.\n\nThe letter from Little White Lion Street does not impress me favourably.\nIt is not written in a simple or truthful manner, I am afraid, and is\n_not_ a good reference. Moreover, I think it probable that the writer\nmay have deserted some pursuit for which he is qualified, for vague and\nlaborious strivings which he has no pretensions to make. However, I will\ncertainly act on your impression of him, whatever it may be. And if you\ncould explain to the gentleman in Nelson Square, that I am not evading\nhis request, but that I do not know of anything to which I can recommend\nhim, it would be a great relief to me.\n\nI trust this new printer _is_ a Tartar; and I hope to God he will so\nproclaim and assert his Tartar breeding, as to excommunicate ---- from\nthe \"chapel\" over which he presides.\n\nTell Powell (with my regards) that he needn't \"deal with\" the American\nnotices of the \"Cricket.\" I never read one word of their abuse, and I\nshould think it base to read their praises. It is something to know that\none is righted so soon; and knowing that, I can afford to know no more.\n\n                                                Ever faithfully yours.",

Is it a\nloving autograph? Does it beam with friendship and affection?\" all of\nwhich I say, as I write, with--oh Heaven!--such a splendid imitation of\nyou, and finally give you one of those grasps and shakes with which I\nhave seen you make the young Icilius stagger again.\n\nHere I am, running away from a bad headache as Tristram Shandy ran away\nfrom death, and lodging for a week in the Hotel de l'Ecu de Geneve,\nwherein there is a large mirror shattered by a cannon-ball in the late\nrevolution. A revolution, whatever its merits, achieved by free spirits,\nnobly generous and moderate, even in the first transports of victory,\nelevated by a splendid popular education, and bent on freedom from all\ntyrants, whether their crowns be shaven or golden. The newspapers may\ntell you what they please. I believe there is no country on earth but\nSwitzerland in which a violent change could have been effected in the\nChristian spirit shown in this place, or in the same proud, independent,\ngallant style. Not one halfpennyworth of property was lost, stolen, or\nstrayed. Not one atom of party malice survived the smoke of the last\ngun. Nothing is expressed in the Government addresses to the citizens\nbut a regard for the general happiness, and injunctions to forget all\nanimosities; which they are practically obeying at every turn, though\nthe late Government (of whose spirit I had some previous knowledge) did\nload the guns with such material as should occasion gangrene in the\nwounds, and though the wounded _do_ die, consequently, every day, in the\nhospital, of sores that in themselves were nothing.\n\n_You_ a mountaineer! _You_ examine (I have seen you do it) the point of\nyour young son's baton de montagne before he went up into the snow! And\n_you_ talk of coming to Lausanne in March! Why, Lord love your heart,\nWilliam Tell, times are changed since you lived at Altorf. There is not\na mountain pass open until June. The snow is closing in on all the\npanorama already. I was at the Great St. Bernard two months ago, and it\nwas bitter cold and frosty then. Do you think I could let you hazard\nyour life by going up any pass worth seeing in bleak March? Never shall\nit be said that Dickens sacrificed his friend upon the altar of his\nhospitality! Onward! To Paris! (Cue for band. Dickens points off with\ntruncheon, first entrance P.S. Page delivers gauntlets on one knee.\nDickens puts 'em on and gradually falls into a fit of musing. Mrs.\nDickens lays her hand upon his shoulder. Business. Procession. Curtain.)\n\nIt is a great pleasure to me, my dear Macready, to hear from yourself,\nas I had previously heard from Forster, that you are so well pleased\nwith \"Dombey,\" which is evidently a great success and a great hit, thank\nGod! I felt that Mrs. Brown was strong, but I was not at all afraid of\ngiving as heavy a blow as I could to a piece of hot iron that lay ready\nat my hand. For that is my principle always, and I hope to come down\nwith some heavier sledge-hammers than that.\n\nI know the lady of whom you write. ---- left there only yesterday. The\nstory may arise only in her manner, which is extraordinarily free and\ncareless. He was visiting her here, when I was here last, three weeks\nago. I knew her in Italy. It is not her fault if scandal ever leaves her\nalone, for such a braver of all conventionalities never wore petticoats.\nBut I should be sorry to hear there was anything guilty in her conduct.\nShe is very clever, really learned, very pretty, much neglected by her\nhusband, and only four-and-twenty years of age.\n\nKate and Georgy send their best loves to Mrs. and Miss Macready and all\nyour house.\n\n                                        Your most affectionate Friend.",

I lose no time in despatching this\nmemorandum of our whereabouts, in order that you may not fail to write\nme a line before you come to Paris on your way towards England, letting\nme know on what day we are to expect you to dinner.\n\nWe arrived here quite happily and well. I don't mean here, but at the\nHotel Brighton, in Paris, on Friday evening, between six and seven\no'clock. The agonies of house-hunting were frightfully severe. It was\none paroxysm for four mortal days. I am proud to express my belief, that\nwe are lodged at last in the most preposterous house in the world. The\nlike of it cannot, and so far as my knowledge goes does not, exist in\nany other part of the globe. The bedrooms are like opera-boxes. The\ndining-rooms, staircases, and passages, quite inexplicable. The\ndining-room is a sort of cavern, painted (ceiling and all) to represent\na grove, with unaccountable bits of looking-glass sticking in among the\nbranches of the trees. There is a gleam of reason in the drawing-room.\nBut it is approached through a series of small chambers, like the joints\nin a telescope, which are hung with inscrutable drapery. The maddest\nman in Bedlam, having the materials given him, would be likely to devise\nsuch a suite, supposing his case to be hopeless and quite incurable.\n\nPray tell Mrs. Watson, with my best regards, that the dance of the two\nsisters in the little Christmas book is being done as an illustration by\nMaclise; and that Stanfield is doing the battle-ground and the outside\nof the Nutmeg Grater Inn. Maclise is also drawing some smaller subjects\nfor the little story, and they write me that they hope it will be very\npretty, and they think that I shall like it. I shall have been in London\nbefore I see you, probably, and I hope the book itself will then be on\nits road to Lausanne to speak for itself, and to speak a word for me\ntoo. I have never left so many friendly and cheerful recollections in\nany place; and to represent me in my absence, its tone should be very\neloquent and affectionate indeed.\n\nWell, if I don't turn up again next summer it shall not be my fault. In\nthe meanwhile, I shall often and often look that way with my mind's eye,\nand hear the sweet, clear, bell-like voice of ---- with the ear of my\nimagination. In the event of there being any change--but it is not\nlikely--in the appearance of his cravat behind, where it goes up into\nhis head, I mean, and frets against his wig--I hope some one of my\nEnglish friends will apprise me of it, for the love of the great Saint\nBernard.\n\nI have not seen Lord Normanby yet. I have not seen anything up to this\ntime but houses and lodgings. There seems to be immense excitement here\non the subject of ---- however, and a perfectly stupendous sensation\ngetting up. I saw the king the other day coming into Paris. His carriage\nwas surrounded by guards on horseback, and he sat very far back in it, I\nthought, and drove at a great pace. It was strange to see the prefet of\npolice on horseback some hundreds of yards in advance, looking to the\nright and left as he rode, like a man who suspected every twig in every\ntree in the long avenue.\n\nThe English relations look anything but promising, though I understand\nthat the Count St. Aulaire is to remain in London, notwithstanding the\nnewspaper alarms to the contrary. If there be anything like the\nsensation in England about ---- that there is here, there will be a\nbitter resentment indeed. The democratic society of Paris have\nannounced, this morning, their intention of printing and circulating\nfifty thousand copies of an appeal in every European language. It is a\nbase business beyond question, and comes at an ill time.\n\nMrs. Dickens and her sister desire their best regards to be sent to you\nand their best loves to Mrs. Watson, in which I join, as nearly as I\nmay. Believe me, with great truth,\n\n                                                 Very sincerely yours.\n\nP.S.--Mrs. Dickens is going to write to Mrs. Watson next week, she says.",

I could have borne a world of\npunch in the rumble and been none the worse for it. There was an\nuncommonly cool inn that night, and quite a monstrous establishment at\nAuxonne the next night, full of flatulent passages and banging doors.\nThe next night we passed at Montbard, where there is one of the very\nbest little inns in all France. The next at Sens, and so we got here.\nThe roads were bad, but not very for French roads. There was no\ndeficiency of horses anywhere; and after Pontarlier the weather was\nreally not too cold for comfort. They weighed our plate at the frontier\ncustom-house, spoon by spoon, and fork by fork, and we lingered about\nthere, in a thick fog and a hard frost, for three long hours and a half,\nduring which the officials committed all manner of absurdities, and got\ninto all sorts of disputes with my brave courier. This was the only\nmisery we encountered--except leaving Lausanne, and that was enough to\nlast us and _did_ last us all the way here. We are living on it now. I\nfelt, myself, much as I should think the murderer felt on that fair\nmorning when, with his gray-haired victim (those unconscious gray hairs,\nsoon to be bedabbled with blood), he went so far towards heaven as the\ntop of that mountain of St. Bernard without one touch of remorse. A\nweight is on my breast. The only difference between me and the murderer\nis, that his weight was guilt and mine is regret.\n\nI haven't a word of news to tell you. I shouldn't write at all if I were\nnot the vainest man in the world, impelled by a belief that you will be\nglad to hear from me, even though you hear no more than that I have\nnothing to say. \"Dombey\" is doing wonders. It went up, after the\npublication of the second number, over the thirty thousand. This is such\na very large sale, so early in the story, that I begin to think it will\nbeat all the rest. Keeley and his wife are making great preparations\nfor producing the Christmas story, and I have made them (as an old stage\nmanager) carry out one or two expensive notions of mine about scenery\nand so forth--in particular a sudden change from the inside of the\ndoctor's house in the midst of the ball to the orchard in the\nsnow--which ought to tell very well. But actors are so bad, in general,\nand the best are spread over so many theatres, that the \"cast\" is black\ndespair and moody madness. There is no one to be got for Marion but a\ncertain Miss ----, I am afraid--a pupil of Miss Kelly's, who acted in\nthe private theatricals I got up a year ago. Macready took her\nafterwards to play Virginia to his Virginius, but she made nothing of\nit, great as the chance was. I have promised to show her what I mean, as\nnear as I can, and if you will look into the English Opera House on the\nmorning of the 17th, 18th, or 19th of next month, between the hours of\neleven and four, you will find me in a very hot and dusty condition,\nplaying all the parts of the piece, to the immense diversion of all the\nactors, actresses, scene-shifters, carpenters, musicians, chorus people,\ntailors, dressmakers, scene-painters, and general ragamuffins of the\ntheatre.\n\nMoore, the poet, is very ill--I fear dying. The last time I saw him was\nimmediately before I left London, and I thought him sadly changed and\ntamed, but not much more so than such a man might be under the heavy\nhand of time. I believe he suffered severe grief in the death of a son\nsome time ago. The first man I met in Paris was ----, who took hold of\nme as I was getting into a coach at the door of the hotel. He hadn't a\nbutton on his shirt (but I don't think he ever has), and you might have\nsown what boys call \"mustard and cress\" in the dust on his coat. I have\nnot seen Lord Normanby yet, as we have only just got a house (the\nqueerest house in Europe!) to lay our heads in; but there seems reason\nto fear that the growing dissensions between England and France, and the\nirritation of the French king, may lead to the withdrawal of the\nminister on each side of the Channel.\n\nHave you cut down any more trees, played any more rubbers, propounded\nany more teasers to the players at the game of Yes and No? How is the\nold horse? How is the gray mare? How is Crab (to whom my respectful\ncompliments)? Have you tried the punch yet; if yes, did it succeed; if\nno, why not? Is Mrs. Cerjat as happy and as well as I would have her,\nand all your house ditto ditto? Does Haldimand play whist with any\nscience yet? Ha, ha, ha! the idea of his saying _I_ hadn't any! And are\nthose damask-cheeked virgins, the Miss ----, still sleeping on dewy rose\nleaves near the English church?\n\nRemember me to all your house, and most of all to its other head, with\nall the regard and earnestness that a \"numble individual\" (as they\nalways call it in the House of Commons) who once travelled with her in a\ncar over a smooth country may charge you with. I have added two lines to\nthe little Christmas book, that I hope both you and she may not dislike.\nHaldimand will tell you what they are. Kate and Georgy send their\nkindest loves, and Kate is \"going\" to write \"next week.\" Believe me\nalways, my dear Cerjat, full of cordial and hearty recollections of this\npast summer and autumn, and your part in my part of them,\n\n                                          Very faithfully your Friend.",

They were in a state so horrible at Keeley's yesterday\n(as perhaps Forster told you when he wrote), that I was obliged to\nengage to read the book to them this morning. It struck me that Mrs.\nLeigh Murray, Miss Daly, and Vining seemed to understand it best.\nCertainly Miss Daly knew best what she was about yesterday. At eight\nto-night we have a rehearsal with scenery and band, and everything but\ndresses. I see no possibility of escaping from it before one or two\no'clock in the morning. And I was at the theatre all day yesterday.\nUnless I had come to London, I do not think there would have been much\nhope of the version being more than just tolerated, even that doubtful.\nAll the actors bad, all the business frightfully behindhand. The very\nwords of the book confused in the copying into the densest and most\ninsufferable nonsense. I must exempt, however, from the general\nslackness both the Keeleys. I hope they will be very good. I have never\nseen anything of its kind better than the manner in which they played\nthe little supper scene between Clemency and Britain, yesterday. It was\nquite perfect, even to me.\n\nThe small manager, Forster, Talfourd, Stanny, and Mac dine with me at\nthe Piazza to-day, before the rehearsal. I have already one or two\nuncommonly good stories of Mac. I reserve them for narration. I have\nalso a dreadful cold, which I would not reserve if I could help it. I\ncan hardly hold up my head, and fight through from hour to hour, but had\nserious thoughts just now of walking off to bed.\n\nChristmas book published to-day--twenty-three thousand copies already\ngone!!! Browne's plates for next \"Dombey\" much better than usual.\n\nI have seen nobody yet, of course. But I sent Roche up to your mother\nthis morning, to say I am in town and will come shortly. There is a\ngreat thaw here to-day, and it is raining hard. I hope you have the\nadvantage (if it be one, which I am not sure of) of a similar change in\nParis. Of course I start again on Thursday. We are expecting (Roche and\nI) a letter from the malle poste people, to whom we have applied for\nplaces. The journey here was long and cold--twenty-four hours from Paris\nto Boulogne. Passage not very bad, and made in two hours.\n\nI find I can't write at all, so I had best leave off. I am looking\nimpatiently for your letter on Monday morning. Give my best love to\nGeorgy, and kisses to all the dear children. And believe me, my love,\n\n                                                  Most affectionately.",

There was no supper to be got,\neither here or anywhere else, after coming out; and I was as hungry and\nthirsty as need be. The scenery and dresses are very good indeed, and\nthey have spent money on it _liberally_. The great change from the\nball-room to the snowy night is most effective, and both the departure\nand the return will tell, I think, strongly on an audience. I have made\nthem very quick and excited in the passionate scenes, and so have\ninfused some appearance of life into those parts of the play. But I\ncan't make a Marion, and Miss ---- is awfully bad. She is a mere nothing\nall through. I put Mr. Leigh Murray into such a state, by making him\ntear about, that the perspiration ran streaming down his face. They have\na great let. I believe every place in the house is taken. Roche is\ngoing.\n\n_Tuesday Morning._--The play went, as well as I can make out--I hoped to\nhave had Stanny's report of it, but he is ill--with great effect. There\nwas immense enthusiasm at its close, and great uproar and shouting for\nme. Forster will go on Wednesday, and write you his account of it.

The malle poste, however, now takes the trains at Amiens. We missed\nit by ten minutes, and had to wait three hours--from twelve o'clock\nuntil three, in which interval I drank brandy and water, and slept like\na top. It is delightful travelling for its speed, that malle poste, and\nreally for its comfort too. But on this occasion it was not remarkable\nfor the last-named quality. The director of the post at Boulogne told me\na lamentable story of his son at Paris being ill, and implored me to\nbring him on. The brave doubted the representations altogether, but I\ncouldn't find it in my heart to say no; so we brought the director,\nbodkinwise, and being a large man, in a great number of greatcoats, he\ncrushed us dismally until we got to the railroad.

WATSON,\n\nI cannot allow your wandering lord to return to your--I suppose \"arms\"\nis not improper--arms, then, without thanking you in half-a-dozen words\nfor your letter, and assuring you that I had great interest and pleasure\nin its receipt, and that I say Amen to all _you_ say of our happy past\nand hopeful future. There is a picture of Lausanne--St. Bernard--the\ntavern by the little lake between Lausanne and Vevay, which is kept by\nthat drunken dog whom Haldimand believes to be so sober--and of many\nother such scenes, within doors and without--that rises up to my mind\nvery often, and in the quiet pleasure of its aspect rather daunts me, as\ncompared with the reality of a stirring life; but, please God, we will\nhave some more pleasant days, and go up some more mountains, somewhere,\nand laugh together, at somebody, and form the same delightful little\ncircle again, somehow.\n\nI quite agree with you about the illustrations to the little Christmas\nbook. I was delighted with yours. Your good lord before-mentioned will\ninform you that it hangs up over my chair in the drawing-room here; and\nwhen you come to England (after I have seen you again in Lausanne) I\nwill show it you in my little study at home, quietly thanking you on the\nbookcase. Then we will go and see some of Turner's recent pictures, and\ndecide that question to Haldimand's utmost confusion.\n\nYou will find Watson looking wonderfully well, I think. When he was\nfirst here, on his way to England, he took an extraordinary bath, in\nwhich he was rubbed all over with chemical compounds, and had everything\ndone to him that could be invented for seven francs. It _may_ be the\ninfluence of this treatment that I see in his face, but I think it's the\nprospect of coming back to Elysee. All I can say is, that when _I_ come\nthat way, and find myself among those friends again, I expect to be\nperfectly lovely--a kind of Glorious Apollo, radiant and shining with\njoy.\n\nKate and her sister send all kinds of love in this hasty packet, and I\nam always, my dear Mrs. Watson,\n\n                                                     Faithfully yours.",

HONORE,\n                                          _Thursday, Jan. 28th, 1847._\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nBefore you read any more, I wish you would take those tablets out of\nyour drawer, in which you have put a black mark against my name, and\nerase it neatly. I don't deserve it, on my word I don't, though\nappearances are against me, I unwillingly confess.\n\nI had gone to Geneva, to recover from an uncommon depression of spirits\nconsequent on too much sitting over \"Dombey\" and the little Christmas\nbook, when I received your letter as I was going out walking, one\nsunshiny, windy day. I read it on the banks of the Rhone, where it runs,\nvery blue and swift, between two high green hills, with ranges of snowy\nmountains filling up the distance. Its cordial and unaffected tone gave\nme the greatest pleasure--did me a world of good--set me up for the\nafternoon, and gave me an evening's subject of discourse. For I talked\nto \"them\" (that is, Kate and Georgy) about those bright mornings at the\nPeschiere, until bedtime, and threatened to write you such a letter next\nday as would--I don't exactly know what it was to do, but it was to be a\ngreat letter, expressive of all kinds of pleasant things, and, perhaps\nthe most genial letter that ever was written.\n\nFrom that hour to this, I have again and again and again said, \"I'll\nwrite to-morrow,\" and here I am to-day full of penitence--really sorry\nand ashamed, and with no excuse but my writing-life, which makes me get\nup and go out, when my morning work is done, and look at pen and ink no\nmore until I begin again.\n\nBesides which, I have been seeing Paris--wandering into hospitals,\nprisons, dead-houses, operas, theatres, concert-rooms, burial-grounds,\npalaces, and wine-shops. In my unoccupied fortnight of each month, every\ndescription of gaudy and ghastly sight has been passing before me in a\nrapid panorama. Before that, I had to come here from Switzerland, over\nfrosty mountains in dense fogs, and through towns with walls and\ndrawbridges, and without population, or anything else in particular but\nsoldiers and mud. I took a flight to London for four days, and went and\ncame back over one sheet of snow, sea excepted; and I wish that had been\nsnow too. Then Forster (who is here now, and begs me to send his kindest\nregards) came to see Paris for himself, and in showing it to him, away I\nwas borne again, like an enchanted rider. In short, I have had no rest\nin my play; and on Monday I am going to work again. A fortnight hence\nthe play will begin once more; a fortnight after that the work will\nfollow round, and so the letters that I care for go unwritten.\n\nDo you care for French news? I hope not, because I don't know any. There\nis a melodrama, called \"The French Revolution,\" now playing at the\nCirque, in the first act of which there is the most tremendous\nrepresentation of _a people_ that can well be imagined. There are\nwonderful battles and so forth in the piece, but there is a power and\nmassiveness in the mob which is positively awful. At another theatre,\n\"Clarissa Harlowe\" is still the rage. There are some things in it rather\ncalculated to astonish the ghost of Richardson, but Clarissa is very\nadmirably played, and dies better than the original to my thinking; but\nRichardson is no great favourite of mine, and never seems to me to take\nhis top-boots off, whatever he does. Several pieces are in course of\nrepresentation, involving rare portraits of the English. In one, a\nservant, called \"Tom Bob,\" who wears a particularly English waistcoat,\ntrimmed with gold lace and concealing his ankles, does very good things\nindeed. In another, a Prime Minister of England, who has ruined himself\nby railway speculations, hits off some of our national characteristics\nvery happily, frequently making incidental mention of \"Vishmingster,\"\n\"Regeenstreet,\" and other places with which you are well acquainted.\n\"Sir Fakson\" is one of the characters in another play--\"English to the\nCore;\" and I saw a Lord Mayor of London at one of the small theatres the\nother night, looking uncommonly well in a stage-coachman's waistcoat,\nthe order of the Garter, and a very low-crowned broad-brimmed hat, not\nunlike a dustman.\n\nI was at Geneva at the time of the revolution. The moderation and\nmildness of the successful party were beyond all praise. Their appeals\nto the people of all parties--printed and pasted on the walls--have no\nparallel that I know of, in history, for their real good sterling\nChristianity and tendency to promote the happiness of mankind. My\nsympathy is strongly with the Swiss radicals. They know what Catholicity\nis; they see, in some of their own valleys, the poverty, ignorance,\nmisery, and bigotry it always brings in its train wherever it is\ntriumphant; and they would root it out of their children's way at any\nprice. I fear the end of the struggle will be, that some Catholic power\nwill step in to crush the dangerously well-educated republics (very\ndangerous to such neighbours); but there is a spirit in the people, or I\nvery much mistake them, that will trouble the Jesuits there many years,\nand shake their altar steps for them.\n\nThis is a poor return (I look down and see the end of the paper) for\nyour letter, but in its cordial spirit of reciprocal friendship, it is\nnot so bad a one if you could read it as I do, and it eases my mind and\ndischarges my conscience. We are coming home, please God, at the end of\nMarch. Kate and Georgy send their best regards to you, and their loves\nto Mrs. and Miss Tagart and the children. _Our_ children wish to live\ntoo in _your_ children's remembrance. You will be glad, I know, to hear\nthat \"Dombey\" is doing wonders, and that the Christmas book shot far\nahead of its predecessors. I hope you will like _the last chapter of No.\n5_. If you can spare me a scrap of your handwriting in token of\nforgiveness, do; if not, I'll come and beg your pardon on the 31st of\nMarch.\n\n                                 Ever believe me,\n                                            Cordially and truly yours.",

There are no visitors in the place but children,\nand they (my own included) have all got the hooping-cough, and go about\nthe beach choking incessantly. A miserable wanderer lectured in a\nlibrary last night about astronomy; but being in utter solitude he\nsnuffed out the transparent planets he had brought with him in a box and\nfled in disgust.

It seems to me to be the very essence of all about the time\nthat I have ever seen in biography or fiction, presented in most wise\nand humane lights, and in a thousand new and just aspects. I have never\nliked Johnson half so well. Nobody's contempt for Boswell ought to be\ncapable of increase, but I have never seen him in my mind's eye half so\nplainly. The introduction of him is quite a masterpiece. I should point\nto that, if I didn't know the author, as being done by somebody with a\nremarkably vivid conception of what he narrated, and a most admirable\nand fanciful power of communicating it to another. All about Reynolds is\ncharming; and the first account of the Literary Club and of Beauclerc as\nexcellent a piece of description as ever I read in my life. But to read\nthe book is to be in the time. It lives again in as fresh and lively a\nmanner as if it were presented on an impossibly good stage by the very\nbest actors that ever lived, or by the real actors come out of their\ngraves on purpose.\n\nAnd as to Goldsmith himself, and _his_ life, and the tracing of it out\nin his own writings, and the manful and dignified assertion of him\nwithout any sobs, whines, or convulsions of any sort, it is throughout a\nnoble achievement, of which, apart from any private and personal\naffection for you, I think (and really believe) I should feel proud, as\none who had no indifferent perception of these books of his--to the best\nof my remembrance--when little more than a child. I was a little afraid\nin the beginning, when he committed those very discouraging imprudences,\nthat you were going to champion him somewhat indiscriminately; but I\nvery soon got over that fear, and found reason in every page to admire\nthe sense, calmness, and moderation with which you make the love and\nadmiration of the reader cluster about him from his youth, and\nstrengthen with his strength--and weakness too, which is better still.\n\nI don't quite agree with you in two small respects. First, I question\nvery much whether it would have been a good thing for every great man to\nhave had his Boswell, inasmuch as I think that two Boswells, or three at\nmost, would have made great men extraordinarily false, and would have\nset them on always playing a part, and would have made distinguished\npeople about them for ever restless and distrustful. I can imagine a\nsuccession of Boswells bringing about a tremendous state of falsehood in\nsociety, and playing the very devil with confidence and friendship.\nSecondly, I cannot help objecting to that practice (begun, I think, or\ngreatly enlarged by Hunt) of italicising lines and words and whole\npassages in extracts, without some very special reason indeed. It does\nappear to be a kind of assertion of the editor over the reader--almost\nover the author himself--which grates upon me. The author might almost\nas well do it himself to my thinking, as a disagreeable thing; and it is\nsuch a strong contrast to the modest, quiet, tranquil beauty of \"The\nDeserted Village,\" for instance, that I would almost as soon hear \"the\ntown crier\" speak the lines. The practice always reminds me of a man\nseeing a beautiful view, and not thinking how beautiful it is half so\nmuch as what he shall say about it.\n\nIn that picture at the close of the third book (a most beautiful one) of\nGoldsmith sitting looking out of window at the Temple trees, you speak\nof the \"gray-eyed\" rooks. Are you sure they are \"gray-eyed\"? The raven's\neye is a deep lustrous black, and so, I suspect, is the rook's, except\nwhen the light shines full into it.\n\nI have reserved for a closing word--though I _don't_ mean to be\neloquent about it, being far too much in earnest--the admirable manner\nin which the case of the literary man is stated throughout this book. It\nis splendid. I don't believe that any book was ever written, or anything\never done or said, half so conducive to the dignity and honour of\nliterature as \"The Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith,\" by J. F.,\nof the Inner Temple. The gratitude of every man who is content to rest\nhis station and claims quietly on literature, and to make no feint of\nliving by anything else, is your due for evermore. I have often said,\nhere and there, when you have been at work upon the book, that I was\nsure it would be; and I shall insist on that debt being due to you\n(though there will be no need for insisting about it) as long as I have\nany tediousness and obstinacy to bestow on anybody. Lastly, I never will\nhear the biography compared with Boswell's except under vigorous\nprotest. For I do say that it is mere folly to put into opposite scales\na book, however amusing and curious, written by an unconscious coxcomb\nlike that, and one which surveys and grandly understands the characters\nof all the illustrious company that move in it.\n\nMy dear Forster, I cannot sufficiently say how proud I am of what you\nhave done, or how sensible I am of being so tenderly connected with it.\nWhen I look over this note, I feel as if I had said no part of what I\nthink; and yet if I were to write another I should say no more, for I\ncan't get it out. I desire no better for my fame, when my personal\ndustiness shall be past the control of my love of order, than such a\nbiographer and such a critic. And again I say, most solemnly, that\nliterature in England has never had, and probably never will have, such\na champion as you are, in right of this book.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

I have lived in hope\nthat Kate and I might be able to run down to see you and yours for a\nday, before our design for enforcing the Government to make Knowles the\nfirst custodian of the Shakespeare house should come off. But I am so\nperpetually engaged in drilling the forces, that I see no hope of making\na pleasant expedition to the Isle of Wight until about the twentieth.\nThen I shall hope to do so for one day. But of this I will advise you\nfurther, in due course.\n\nMy doubts about the house you speak of are twofold, First, I could not\nleave town so soon as May, having affairs to arrange for a sick sister.\nAnd secondly, I fear Bonchurch is not sufficiently bracing for my\nchickens, who thrive best in breezy and cool places. This has set me\nthinking, sometimes of the Yorkshire coast, sometimes of Dover. I would\nnot have the house at Bonchurch reserved for me, therefore. But if it\nshould be empty, we will go and look at it in a body. I reserve the more\nserious part of my letter until the last, my dear White, because it\ncomes from the bottom of my heart. None of your friends have thought and\nspoken oftener of you and Mrs. White than we have these many weeks past.\nI should have written to you, but was timid of intruding on your sorrow.\nWhat you say, and the manner in which you tell me I am connected with it\nin your recollection of your dear child, now among the angels of God,\ngives me courage to approach your grief--to say what sympathy we have\nfelt with it, and how we have not been unimaginative of these deep\nsources of consolation to which you have had recourse. The traveller\nwho journeyed in fancy from this world to the next was struck to the\nheart to find the child he had lost, many years before, building him a\ntower in heaven. Our blessed Christian hopes do not shut out the belief\nof love and remembrance still enduring there, but irradiate it and make\nit sacred. Who should know that better than you, or who more deeply feel\nthe touching truths and comfort of that story in the older book, where,\nwhen the bereaved mother is asked, \"Is it well with the child?\" she\nanswers, \"It _is_ well.\"\n\nGod be with you.

WATSON,\n\nI thought to have been at Rockingham long ago! It seems a century since\nI, standing in big boots on the Haymarket stage, saw you come into a box\nupstairs and look down on the humbled Bobadil, since then I have had the\nkindest of notes from you, since then the finest of venison, and yet I\nhave not seen the Rockingham flowers, and they are withering I daresay.\n\nBut we have acted at Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Edinburgh, and\nGlasgow; and the business of all this--and graver and heavier daily\noccupation in going to see a dying sister at Hornsey--has so worried me\nthat I have hardly had an hour, far less a week. I shall never be quite\nhappy, in a theatrical point of view, until you have seen me play in an\nEnglish version of the French piece, \"L'Homme Blase,\" which fairly\nturned the head of Glasgow last Thursday night as ever was; neither\nshall I be quite happy, in a social point of view, until I have been to\nRockingham again. When the first event will come about Heaven knows. The\nlatter will happen about the end of the November fogs and wet weather.\nFor am I not going to Broadstairs now, to walk about on the sea-shore\n(why don't you bring your rosy children there?) and think what is to be\ndone for Christmas! An idea occurs to me all at once. I must come down\nand read you that book before it's published. Shall it be a bargain?\nWere you all in Switzerland? I don't believe _I_ ever was. It is such a\ndream now. I wonder sometimes whether I ever disputed with a Haldimand;\nwhether I ever drank mulled wine on the top of the Great St. Bernard, or\nwas jovial at the bottom with company that have stolen into my\naffection; whether I ever was merry and happy in that valley on the Lake\nof Geneva, or saw you one evening (when I didn't know you) walking down\namong the green trees outside Elysee, arm-in-arm with a gentleman in a\nwhite hat. I am quite clear that there is no foundation for these\nvisions. But I should like to go somewhere, too, and try it all over\nagain. I don't know how it is, but the ideal world in which my lot is\ncast has an odd effect on the real one, and makes it chiefly precious\nfor such remembrances. I get quite melancholy over them sometimes,\nespecially when, as now, those great piled-up semicircles of bright\nfaces, at which I have lately been looking--all laughing, earnest and\nintent--have faded away like dead people. They seem a ghostly moral of\neverything in life to me.\n\nKate sends her best love, in which Georgy would as heartily unite, I\nknow, but that she is already gone to Broadstairs with the children. We\nthink of following on Saturday morning, but that depends on my poor\nsister. Pray give my most cordial remembrances to Watson, and tell him\nthey include a great deal. I meant to have written you a letter. I don't\nknow what this is. There is no word for it. So, if you will still let me\nowe you one, I will pay my debt, on the smallest encouragement, from the\nseaside. Here, there, and elsewhere, I am, with perfect truth, believe\nme,\n\n                                                Very faithfully yours.",

I know well that you propose it in \"affectionate\nregard,\" and value and esteem it, therefore, in a way not easy of\nexpression.\n\nYou were talking of \"coming\" down, and now, in a mean and dodging way,\nyou write about \"sending\" the second act! I have a propogician to make.\nCome down on Friday. There is a train leaves London Bridge at two--gets\nhere at four. By that time I shall be ready to strike work. We can take\na little walk, dine, discuss, and you can go back in good time next\nmorning. I really think this ought to be done, and indeed MUST be done.\nWrite and say it shall be done.\n\nA little management will be required in dramatising the third part,\nwhere there are some things I _describe_ (for effect's sake, and as a\nmatter of art) which must be _said_ on the stage. Redlaw is in a new\ncondition of mind, which fact must be shot point-blank at the audience,\nI suppose, \"as from the deadly level of a gun.\" By anybody who knew how\nto play Milly, I think it might be made very good. Its effect is very\npleasant upon me. I have also given Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby another\ninnings.\n\nI went to the play last night--fifth act of Richard the Third. Richmond\nby a stout _lady_, with a particularly well-developed bust, who finished\nall the speeches with the soubrette simper. Also, at the end of the\ntragedy she came forward (still being Richmond) and said, \"Ladies and\ngentlemen, on Wednesday next the entertainments will be for _My_\nbenefit, when I hope to meet your approbation and support.\" Then, having\nbowed herself into the stage-door, she looked out of it, and said,\nwinningly, \"Won't you come?\" which was enormously applauded.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[7] LETTER OF BARON TAUeCHNITZ.\n\nHaving had the privilege to see a letter which the late Mr. Charles\nDickens wrote to the author of this work upon its first appearance, and\nwhich there was no intention to publish in England, it became my lively\nwish to make it known to the readers of my edition.\n\nI therefore addressed an earnest request to Mr. Forster, that he would\npermit the letter to be prefixed to a reprint not designed for\ncirculation in England, where I could understand his reluctance to\nsanction its publication. Its varied illustration of the subject of the\nbook, and its striking passages of personal feeling and character, led\nme also to request that I might be allowed to present it in facsimile.\n\nMr. Forster complied; and I am most happy to be thus enabled to give to\nmy public, on the following pages, so attractive and so interesting a\nletter, reproduced in the exact form in which it was written, by the\nmost popular and admired-of writers--too early gone.\n\nTAUeCHNITZ.\n\nLeipsic, _May 23, 1873._",

Cerjat.]\n\n                      DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Saturday, Dec. 29th, 1849._\n\nMY DEAR CERJAT,\n\nI received your letter at breakfast-time this morning with a pleasure my\neloquence is unable to express and your modesty unable to conceive. It\nis so delightful to be remembered at this time of the year in your house\nwhere we have been so happy, and in dear old Lausanne, that we always\nhope to see again, that I can't help pushing away the first page of\n\"Copperfield\" No. 10, now staring at me with what I may literally call a\nblank aspect, and plunging energetically into this reply.\n\nWhat a strange coincidence that is about Blunderstone House! Of all the\nodd things I have ever heard (and their name is Legion), I think it is\nthe oddest. I went down into that part of the country on the 7th of\nJanuary last year, when I was meditating the story, and chose\nBlunderstone for the sound of its name. I had previously observed much\nof what you say about the poor girls. In all you suggest with so much\nfeeling about their return to virtue being cruelly cut off, I concur\nwith a sore heart. I have been turning it over in my mind for some time,\nand hope, in the history of Little Em'ly (who _must_ fall--there is no\nhope for her), to put it before the thoughts of people in a new and\npathetic way, and perhaps to do some good. You will be glad to hear, I\nknow, that \"Copperfield\" is a great success. I think it is better liked\nthan any of my other books.\n\nWe had a most delightful time at Watsons' (for both of them we have\npreserved and strengthened a real affection), and were the gayest of the\ngay. There was a Miss Boyle staying in the house, who is an excellent\namateur actress, and she and I got up some scenes from \"The School for\nScandal\" and from \"Nickleby,\" with immense success. We played in the old\nhall, with the audience filled up and running over with servants. The\nentertainments concluded with feats of legerdemain (for the performance\nof which I have a pretty good apparatus, collected at divers times and\nin divers places), and we then fell to country dances of a most frantic\ndescription, and danced all night. We often spoke of you and Mrs. Cerjat\nand of Haldimand, and wished you were all there. Watson and I have some\nfifty times \"registered a vow\" (like O'Connell) to come to Lausanne\ntogether, and have even settled in what month and week. Something or\nother has always interposed to prevent us; but I hope, please God, most\ncertainly to see it again, when my labours-Copperfieldian shall have\nterminated.\n\nYou have no idea what that hanging of the Mannings really was. The\nconduct of the people was so indescribably frightful, that I felt for\nsome time afterwards almost as if I were living in a city of devils. I\nfeel, at this hour, as if I never could go near the place again. My\nletters have made a great to-do, and led to a great agitation of the\nsubject; but I have not a confident belief in any change being made,\nmainly because the total abolitionists are utterly reckless and\ndishonest (generally speaking), and would play the deuce with any such\nproposition in Parliament, unless it were strongly supported by the\nGovernment, which it would certainly not be, the Whig motto (in office)\nbeing \"_laissez aller_.\" I think Peel might do it if he came in. Two\npoints have occurred to me as being a good commentary to the objections\nto my idea. The first is that a most terrific uproar was made when the\nhanging processions were abolished, and the ceremony shrunk from Tyburn\nto the prison door. The second is that, at this very time, under the\nBritish Government in New South Wales, executions take place _within the\nprison walls_, with decidedly improved results. (I am waiting to explode\nthis fact on the first man of mark who gives me the opportunity.)\n\nUnlike you, we have had no marriages or giving in marriage here. We\nmight have had, but a certain young lady, whom you know, is hard to\nplease. The children are all well, thank God! Charley is going to Eton\nthe week after next, and has passed a first-rate examination. Kate is\nquite well, and unites with me and Georgina in love to you and Mrs.\nCerjat and Haldimand, whom I would give a good deal (tell him) to have\nseveral hours' contradiction of at his own table. Good heavens, how\nobstinate we would both be! I see him leaning back in his chair, with\nhis right forefinger out, and saying, \"Good God!\" in reply to some\nproposition of mine, and then laughing.\n\nAll in a moment a feeling comes over me, as if you and I have been still\ntalking, smoking cigars outside the inn at Martigny, the piano sounding\ninside, and Lady Mary Taylour singing. I look into my garden (which is\ncovered with snow) rather dolefully, but take heart again, and look\nbrightly forward to another expedition to the Great St. Bernard, when\nMrs. Cerjat and I shall laugh as I fancy I have never laughed since, in\none of those one-sided cars; and when we shall again learn from\nHaldimand, in a little dingy cabaret, at lunch-time, how to secure a\ndoor in travelling (do you remember?) by balancing a chair against it on\nits two hind-legs.\n\nI do hope that we may all come together again once more, while there is\na head of hair left among us; and in this hope remain, my dear Cerjat,\n\n                                                 Your faithful Friend.",

I should set a value on your help which your modesty can\nhardly imagine; and I am perfectly sure that the least result of your\nreflection or observation in respect of the life around you, would\nattract attention and do good.\n\nOf course I regard your time as valuable, and consider it so when I ask\nyou if you could devote any of it to this purpose.\n\nIf you could and would prefer to speak to me on the subject, I should be\nvery glad indeed to come to Manchester for a few hours and explain\nanything you might wish to know.

Being brought back in triumph, he made a number of fictitious\nstarts, for the sake of being overtaken again, and we made a regular\ngame of it. At last, when he and Ally had run away, instead of running\nafter them, we came into the garden, shut the gate, and crouched down on\nthe ground. Presently we heard them come back and say to each other with\nsome alarm, \"Why, the gate's shut, and they're all gone!\" Ally began in\na dismayed way to cry out, but the Phenomenon shouting, \"Open the gate!\"\nsent an enormous stone flying into the garden (among our heads) by way\nof alarming the establishment. I thought it a wonderful piece of\ncharacter, showing great readiness of resource. He would have fired a\nperfect battery of stones, or very likely have broken the pantry window,\nI think, if we hadn't let him in.\n\nThey are all in great force, and send their loves. They are all much\nexcited with the expectation of receiving you on Friday, and would start\nme off to fetch you now if I would go.\n\nOur train on Friday will be half-past twelve.

They will\nrequire to be so exactly explained to your carpenter (though very easy\nlittle things in themselves), that I think I had better, before\nChristmas, send my servant down for an hour--he is quite an old stager\nnow--to show him precisely what I mean. It is not a day's work, but it\nwould be extremely difficult to explain in writing. I developed these\nwonderful ideas to the master carpenter at one of the theatres, and he\nshook his head with an intensely mournful air, and said, \"Ah, sir, it's\na universal observation in the profession, sir, that it was a great loss\nto the public when you took to writing books!\" which I thought\ncomplimentary to \"Copperfield.\"\n\n                                                Ever faithfully yours.",

WATSON,\n\nI shall be delighted to come on the seventh instead of the eighth. We\nconsider it an engagement. Over and above the pleasure of a quiet day\nwith you, I think I can greatly facilitate the preparations (that's the\nway, you see, in which we cheat ourselves into making duties of\npleasures) by being at Rockingham a day earlier. So that's settled.\n\nI was quite certain when that Child of Israel mentioned those\ndimensions, that he must be wrong. For which wooden-headedness the Child\nshall be taken to task on Monday morning, when I am going to look at his\npreparations, by appointment, about the door. Don't you observe, that\nthe scenery not being made expressly for the room, it may be impossible\nto use it as you propose? There is a scene before that wall, and unless\nthe door in the scene (supposing there to be one, which I am not sure\nof) should come exactly into the place of the door of the room, the door\nof the room might as well be in Africa. If it could be used it would\nstill require to be backed (excuse professional technicality) by another\nscene in the passage. And if it be rather in the side of the bottom of\nthe room (as I seem to remember it), it would be shut out of sight, or\npartially, by the side scenes. Do you comprehend these stage managerial\nsagacities? That piece of additional room in so small a stage would be\nof immense service, if we could avail ourselves of it. If we can't, I\nhave another means (I think) of discovering Leech, Saville, and\nColdstream at table. I am constantly turning over in my mind the\ncapacities of the place, and hope by one means or other to make\nsomething more than the best of it. As to the fireplace, you will never\nbe able to use that. The heat of the lamp will be very great, and\nventilation will be the thing wanted. Thirteen feet and a half of depth,\ndiminished by stage fittings and furniture, is a small space. I think\nthe doorway could be used in the last scene, with the castle steps and\nplatform for the staircase running straight through it toward the hall.\n_Nous verrons._ I will write again about my visit of inspection,\nprobably on Monday.\n\nWill you let them know that Messrs. Nathan, of Titchborne Street,\nHaymarket, will dress them, please, and that I will engage for their\ndoing it thoroughly well; also that Mr. Wilson, theatrical hairdresser,\nStrand, near St. Clement's Churchyard, will come down with wigs, etc.,\nto \"make up\" everybody; that he has a list of the pieces from me, and\nthat he will be glad to measure the heads and consult the tastes of all\nconcerned, if they will give him the opportunity beforehand? I should\nlike to see Sir Adonis Leech and the Hon. T. Saville if I can. For they\nought to be wonderfully made up, and to be as unlike themselves as\npossible, and to contrast well with each other and with me. I rather\ngrudge _caro sposo_ coming into the company. I should like him so much\nto see the play. If we do it all well together it ought to be so very\npleasant. I never saw a great mass of people so charmed with a little\nstory as when we acted it at the Glasgow Theatre. But I have no other\nreason for faltering when I take him to my arms. I feel that he is the\nman for the part.[10] I see him with a blue bag, a flaxen wig, and green\nspectacles. I know what it will be. I foresee how all that sessional\nexperience will come out. I reconcile myself to it, in spite of the\nselfish consideration of wanting him elsewhere; and while I have a heavy\nsense of a light being snuffed out in the audience, perceive a new\nluminary shining on the stage!\n\nYour brother[11] would make a capital tiger, too! Very short tight\nsurtout, doeskins, bright top-boots, white cravat, bouquet in\nbutton-hole, close wig--very good, ve--ry good. It clearly must be so.\nThe thing is done. I told you we were opening a tremendous\ncorrespondence when we first began to write on such a long subject. But\ndo let me tell you, once and for all, that I am in the business heart\nand soul, and that you cannot trouble me respecting it, and that I\nwouldn't willingly or knowingly leave the minutest detail unprovided\nfor. It cannot possibly be a success if the smallest peppercorn of\narrangement be omitted. And a success it must be! I couldn't go into\nsuch a thing, or help to bring you poorly out of it, for any earthly\nconsideration. Talking of forgetting, isn't it odd? I doubt if I could\nforget words I had learned, so long as I wanted them. But the moment the\nnecessity goes, they go. I know my place and everybody's place in this\nidentical piece of \"Used Up\" perfectly, and could put every little\nobject on its own square inches of room exactly where it ought to be.\nBut I have no more recollection of my words now (I took the book up\nyesterday) than if I had only seen the play as one of the audience at a\ntheatre. Perhaps not so much. With cordial remembrances,\n\n                                    Ever, dear Mrs. Watson,\n                                                     Faithfully yours.",

I think I have told you\nsometimes, my much-loved friend, how, when I was a mere boy, I was one\nof your faithful and devoted adherents in the pit; I believe as true a\nmember of that true host of followers as it has ever boasted.

We might have a \"night-cap,\" a fire, and some tea\nat the office hard by. If you could conveniently borrow an hour or two\nfrom the night we could both go. If not, I would go alone. It would make\na wonderful good paper at a most appropriate time, when the back slums\nof London are going to be invaded by all sorts of strangers.\n\nYou needn't exactly say that _I_ was going _in propria_ (unless it were\nnecessary), and, of course, you wouldn't say that I propose to-night,\nbecause I am so worn by the sad arrangements in which I am engaged, and\nby what led to them, that I cannot take my natural rest. But to-morrow\nnight we go to the gas-works. I might not be so disposed for this\nstation-house observation as I shall be to-night for a long time, and I\nsee a most singular and admirable chance for us in the descriptive way,\nnot to be lost.\n\nTherefore, if you will arrange the thing before I come down at four this\nafternoon, any of the Scotland Yard people will do it, I should think;\nif our friend by any accident should not be there, I will go into it.\n\nIf they should recommend any other station-house as better for the\npurpose, or would think it better for us to go to more than one under\nthe guidance of some trustworthy man, of course we will pay any man and\ndo as they recommend.

The comedy has\nbeen very much improved, in many respects, since you read it. The scene\nto which you refer is certainly one of the most telling in the play. And\nthere _is_ a farce to be produced on Tuesday next, wherein a\ndistinguished amateur will sustain a variety of assumption-parts, and in\nparticular, Samuel Weller and Mrs. Gamp, of which I say no more. I am\npining for Broadstairs, where the children are at present. I lurk from\nthe sun, during the best part of the day, in a villainous compound of\ndarkness, canvas, sawdust, general dust, stale gas (involving a vague\nsmell of pepper), and disenchanted properties. But I hope to get down on\nWednesday or Thursday.\n\nAh! you country gentlemen, who live at home at ease, how little do you\nthink of us among the London fleas! But they tell me you are coming in\nfor Dorsetshire. You must be very careful, when you come to town to\nattend to your parliamentary duties, never to ask your way of people in\nthe streets. They will misdirect you for what the vulgar call \"a lark,\"\nmeaning, in this connection, a jest at your expense. Always go into some\nrespectable shop or apply to a policeman. You will know him by his being\ndressed in blue, with very dull silver buttons, and by the top of his\nhat being made of sticking-plaster. You may perhaps see in some odd\nplace an intelligent-looking man, with a curious little wooden table\nbefore him and three thimbles on it. He will want you to bet, but don't\ndo it. He really desires to cheat you. And don't buy at auctions where\nthe best plated goods are being knocked down for next to nothing. These,\ntoo, are delusions. If you wish to go to the play to see real good\nacting (though a little more subdued than perfect tragedy should be), I\nwould recommend you to see ---- at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Anybody\nwill show it to you. It is near the Strand, and you may know it by\nseeing no company whatever at any of the doors. Cab fares are eightpence\na mile. A mile London measure is half a Dorsetshire mile, recollect.\nPorter is twopence per pint; what is called stout is fourpence. The\nZoological Gardens are in the Regent's Park, and the price of admission\nis one shilling. Of the streets, I would recommend you to see Regent\nStreet and the Quadrant, Bond Street, Piccadilly, Oxford Street, and\nCheapside. I think these will please you after a time, though the tumult\nand bustle will at first bewilder you. If I can serve you in any way,\npray command me. And with my best regards to your happy family, so\nremote from this Babel,\n\n                           Believe me, my dear Friend,\n                                            Ever affectionately yours.\n\nP.S.--I forgot to mention just now that the black equestrian figure you\nwill see at Charing Cross, as you go down to the House, is a statue of\n_King Charles the First_.",

WATSON,\n\nI am so desperately indignant with you for writing me that short apology\nfor a note, and pretending to suppose that under any circumstances I\ncould fail to read with interest anything _you_ wrote to me, that I have\nmore than half a mind to inflict a regular letter upon you. If I were\nnot the gentlest of men I should do it!\n\nPoor dear Haldimand, I have thought of him so often. That kind of decay\nis so inexpressibly affecting and piteous to me, that I have no words to\nexpress my compassion and sorrow. When I was at Abbotsford, I saw in a\nvile glass case the last clothes Scott wore. Among them an old white\nhat, which seemed to be tumbled and bent and broken by the uneasy,\npurposeless wandering, hither and thither, of his heavy head. It so\nembodied Lockhart's pathetic description of him when he tried to write,\nand laid down his pen and cried, that it associated itself in my mind\nwith broken powers and mental weakness from that hour. I fancy Haldimand\nin such another, going listlessly about that beautiful place, and\nremembering the happy hours we have passed with him, and his goodness\nand truth. I think what a dream we live in, until it seems for the\nmoment the saddest dream that ever was dreamed. Pray tell us if you hear\nmore of him. We really loved him.\n\nTo go to the opposite side of life, let me tell you that a week or so\nago I took Charley and three of his schoolfellows down the river\ngipsying. I secured the services of Charley's godfather (an old friend\nof mine, and a noble fellow with boys), and went down to Slough,\naccompanied by two immense hampers from Fortnum and Mason, on (I\nbelieve) the wettest morning ever seen out of the tropics.\n\nIt cleared before we got to Slough; but the boys, who had got up at four\n(we being due at eleven), had horrible misgivings that we might not\ncome, in consequence of which we saw them looking into the carriages\nbefore us, all face. They seemed to have no bodies whatever, but to be\nall face; their countenances lengthened to that surprising extent. When\nthey saw us, the faces shut up as if they were upon strong springs, and\ntheir waistcoats developed themselves in the usual places. When the\nfirst hamper came out of the luggage-van, I was conscious of their\ndancing behind the guard; when the second came out with bottles in it,\nthey all stood wildly on one leg. We then got a couple of flys to drive\nto the boat-house. I put them in the first, but they couldn't sit still\na moment, and were perpetually flying up and down like the toy figures\nin the sham snuff-boxes. In this order we went on to \"Tom Brown's, the\ntailor's,\" where they all dressed in aquatic costume, and then to the\nboat-house, where they all cried in shrill chorus for \"Mahogany\"--a\ngentleman, so called by reason of his sunburnt complexion, a waterman by\nprofession. (He was likewise called during the day \"Hog\" and \"Hogany,\"\nand seemed to be unconscious of any proper name whatsoever.) We\nembarked, the sun shining now, in a galley with a striped awning, which\nI had ordered for the purpose, and all rowing hard, went down the river.\nWe dined in a field; what I suffered for fear those boys should get\ndrunk, the struggles I underwent in a contest of feeling between\nhospitality and prudence, must ever remain untold. I feel, even now, old\nwith the anxiety of that tremendous hour. They were very good, however.\nThe speech of one became thick, and his eyes too like lobsters' to be\ncomfortable, but only temporarily. He recovered, and I suppose outlived\nthe salad he took. I have heard nothing to the contrary, and I imagine I\nshould have been implicated on the inquest if there had been one. We had\ntea and rashers of bacon at a public-house, and came home, the last five\nor six miles in a prodigious thunderstorm. This was the great success of\nthe day, which they certainly enjoyed more than anything else. The\ndinner had been great, and Mahogany had informed them, after a bottle of\nlight champagne, that he never would come up the river \"with ginger\ncompany\" any more. But the getting so completely wet through was the\nculminating part of the entertainment. You never in your life saw such\nobjects as they were; and their perfect unconsciousness that it was at\nall advisable to go home and change, or that there was anything to\nprevent their standing at the station two mortal hours to see me off,\nwas wonderful. As to getting them to their dames with any sort of sense\nthat they were damp, I abandoned the idea. I thought it a success when\nthey went down the street as civilly as if they were just up and newly\ndressed, though they really looked as if you could have rubbed them to\nrags with a touch, like saturated curl-paper.\n\nI am sorry you have not been able to see our play, which I suppose you\nwon't now, for I take it you are not going on Monday, the 21st, our last\nnight in town? It is worth seeing, not for the getting up (which modesty\nforbids me to approve), but for the little bijou it is, in the scenery,\ndresses, and appointments. They are such as never can be got together\nagain, because such men as Stanfield, Roberts, Grieve, Haghe, Egg, and\nothers, never can be again combined in such a work. Everything has been\ndone at its best from all sorts of authorities, and it is really very\nbeautiful to look at.\n\nI find I am \"used up\" by the Exhibition. I don't say \"there is nothing\nin it\"--there's too much. I have only been twice; so many things\nbewildered me. I have a natural horror of sights, and the fusion of so\nmany sights in one has not decreased it. I am not sure that I have seen\nanything but the fountain and perhaps the Amazon. It is a dreadful thing\nto be obliged to be false, but when anyone says, \"Have you seen ----?\" I\nsay, \"Yes,\" because if I don't, I know he'll explain it, and I can't\nbear that. ---- took all the school one day. The school was composed of\na hundred \"infants,\" who got among the horses' legs in crossing to the\nmain entrance from the Kensington Gate, and came reeling out from\nbetween the wheels of coaches undisturbed in mind. They were clinging to\nhorses, I am told, all over the park.\n\nWhen they were collected and added up by the frantic monitors, they were\nall right. They were then regaled with cake, etc., and went tottering\nand staring all over the place; the greater part wetting their\nforefingers and drawing a wavy pattern on every accessible object. One\ninfant strayed. He was not missed. Ninety and nine were taken home,\nsupposed to be the whole collection, but this particular infant went to\nHammersmith. He was found by the police at night, going round and round\nthe turnpike, which he still supposed to be a part of the Exhibition. He\nhad the same opinion of the police, also of Hammersmith workhouse, where\nhe passed the night. When his mother came for him in the morning, he\nasked when it would be over? It was a great Exhibition, he said, but he\nthought it long.\n\nAs I begin to have a foreboding that you will think the same of this act\nof vengeance of mine, this present letter, I shall make an end of it,\nwith my heartiest and most loving remembrances to Watson. I should have\nliked him of all things to have been in the Eton expedition, tell him,\nand to have heard a song (by-the-bye, I have forgotten that) sung in the\nthunderstorm, solos by Charley, chorus by the friends, describing the\ncareer of a booby who was plucked at college, every verse ending:\n\n        I don't care a fig what the people may think,\n        But what WILL the governor say!\n\nwhich was shouted with a deferential jollity towards myself, as a\ngovernor who had that day done a creditable action, and proved himself\nworthy of all confidence.\n\n           With love to the boys and girls,\n                                Ever, dear Mrs. Watson,\n                                                 Most sincerely yours.",

Will you look carefully at all the earlier part,\nwhere the use of the past tense instead of the present a little hurts\nthe picturesque effect? I understand each phase of the thing to be\n_always a thing present before the mind's eye_--a shadow passing before\nit. Whatever is done, must be _doing_. Is it not so? For example, if I\ndid the Shadow of Robinson Crusoe, I should not say he _was_ a boy at\nHull, when his father lectured him about going to sea, and so forth; but\nhe _is_ a boy at Hull. There he is, in that particular Shadow, eternally\na boy at Hull; his life to me is a series of shadows, but there is no\n\"was\" in the case. If I choose to go to his manhood, I can. These\nshadows don't change as realities do. No phase of his existence passes\naway, if I choose to bring it to this unsubstantial and delightful life,\nthe only death of which, to me, is _my_ death, and thus he is immortal\nto unnumbered thousands.

The drawing-room encourages no hope whatever, nor\nthe study. Staircase painted. Irish labourers howling in the\nschool-room, but I don't know why. I see nothing. Gardener vigorously\nlopping the trees, and really letting in the light and air. Foreman\nsweet-tempered but uneasy. Inimitable hovering gloomily through the\npremises all day, with an idea that a little more work is done when he\nflits, bat-like, through the rooms, than when there is no one looking\non. Catherine all over paint. Mister McCann, encountering Inimitable in\ndoorways, fades obsequiously into areas, and there encounters him again,\nand swoons with confusion. Several reams of blank paper constantly\nspread on the drawing-room walls, and sliced off again, which looks like\ninsanity. Two men still clinking at the new stair-rails. I think they\nmust be learning a tune; I cannot make out any other object in their\nproceedings.\n\nSince writing the above, I have been up there again, and found the young\npaper-hanger putting on his slippers, and looking hard at the walls of\nthe servants' room at the top of the house, as if he meant to paper it\none of these days.

The\nenthusiasm was prodigious; the place delightful for speaking in; no end\nof gas; another hall for a dressing-room; an immense stage; and every\npossible convenience. We were all thoroughly pleased, I think, with the\nwhole thing, and it was a very great and striking success.\nTo-morrow-night, having the new Hardman, I am going to try the play with\nall kinds of cuts, taking out, among other things, some half-dozen\nprinted pages of \"Wills's Coffee House.\"\n\nWe are very pleasant and cheerful. They are all going to Matthew\nDavenport Hill's to lunch this morning, and to see some woods about six\nor seven miles off. I prefer being quiet, and shall go out at my leisure\nand call on Elliot. We are very well lodged and boarded, and, living\nhigh up on the Downs, are quite out of the filth of Bristol.\n\nI saw old Landor at Bath, who has bronchitis.

Macready.]\n\n                                TAVISTOCK HOUSE, _January 31st, 1852._\n\nMY DEAR MACREADY,\n\nIf the \"taxes on knowledge\" mean the stamp duty, the paper duty, and the\nadvertisement duty, they seem to me to be unnecessarily confounded, and\nunfairly too.\n\nI have already declined to sign a petition for the removal of the stamp\nduty on newspapers. I think the reduced duty is some protection to the\npublic against the rash and hasty launching of blackguard newspapers. I\nthink the newspapers are made extremely accessible to the poor man at\npresent, and that he would not derive the least benefit from the\nabolition of the stamp. It is not at all clear to me, supposing he wants\n_The Times_ a penny cheaper, that he would get it a penny cheaper if the\ntax were taken off. If he supposes he would get in competition two or\nthree new journals as good to choose from, he is mistaken; not knowing\nthe immense resources and the gradually perfective machinery necessary\nto the production of such a journal. It appears to me to be a fair tax\nenough, very little in the way of individuals, not embarrassing to the\npublic in its mode of being levied, and requiring some small\nconsideration and pauses from the American kind of newspaper projectors.\nFurther, a committee has reported in favour of the repeal, and the\nsubject may be held to need no present launching.\n\nThe repeal of the paper duty would benefit the producers of periodicals\nimmensely. It would make a very large difference to me, in the case of\nsuch a journal as \"Household Words.\" But the gain to the public would be\nvery small. It would not make the difference of enabling me, for\nexample, to reduce the price of \"Household Words,\" by its fractional\neffect upon a copy, or to increase the quantity of matter. I might, in\nputting the difference into my pocket, improve the quality of the paper\na little, but not one man in a thousand would notice it. It _might_\n(though I am not sure even of this) remove the difficulties in the way\nof a deserving periodical with a small sale. Charles Knight holds that\nit would. But the case, on the whole, appeared to me so slight, when I\nwent to Downing Street with a deputation on the subject, that I said (in\naddressing the Chancellor of the Exchequer) I could not honestly\nmaintain it for a moment as against the soap duty, or any other pressing\non the mass of the poor.\n\nThe advertisement duty has this preposterous anomaly, that a footman in\nwant of a place pays as much in the way of tax for the expression of his\nwant, as Professor Holloway pays for the whole list of his miraculous\ncures.\n\nBut I think, at this time especially, there is so much to be considered\nin the necessity the country will be under of having money, and the\nnecessity of justice it is always under, to consider the physical and\nmoral wants of the poor man's home, as to justify a man in saying: \"I\nmust wait a little, all taxes are more or less objectionable, and so no\ndoubt are these, but we must have some; and I have not made up my mind\nthat all these things that are mixed up together _are_ taxes on\nknowledge in reality.\"\n\nKate and Georgy unite with me in kindest and heartiest love to dear Mrs.\nMacready. We are always with you in spirit, and always talking about\nyou. I am obliged to conclude very hastily, being beset to-day with\nbusiness engagements. Saw the lecture and was delighted; thought the\nidea admirable. Again, loves upon loves to dear Mrs. Macready and to\nMiss Macready also, and Kate and all the house.

I abstain from\ndrawing the strange comparison that might be drawn between the sums even\nnow expended in endeavours to remove the darkest ignorance and\ndegradation from our very doors, because I have some respect for\nmistakes that may be founded in a sincere wish to do good. But I present\na general suggestion of the still-existing anomaly (in such a paragraph\nas that which offends you), in the hope of inducing some people to\nreflect on this matter, and to adjust the balance more correctly. I am\ndecidedly of opinion that the two works, the home and the foreign, are\n_not_ conducted with an equal hand, and that the home claim is by far\nthe stronger and the more pressing of the two.\n\nIndeed, I have very grave doubts whether a great commercial country,\nholding communication with all parts of the world, can better\nChristianise the benighted portions of it than by the bestowal of its\nwealth and energy on the making of good Christians at home, and on the\nutter removal of neglected and untaught childhood from its streets,\nbefore it wanders elsewhere. For, if it steadily persist in this work,\nworking downward to the lowest, the travellers of all grades whom it\nsends abroad will be good, exemplary, practical missionaries, instead of\nundoers of what the best professed missionaries can do.\n\nThese are my opinions, founded, I believe, on some knowledge of facts\nand some observation. If I could be scared out of them, let me add in\nall good humour, by such easily-impressed words as \"antichristian\" or\n\"irreligious,\" I should think that I deserved them in their real\nsignification.\n\nI have referred in vain to page 312 of \"Household Words\" for the sneer\nto which you call my attention. Nor have I, I assure you, the least idea\nwhere else it is to be found.\n\n                                     I am, Sir, your faithful Servant.",

The description of the family is quite\namazing. I _must_ return it myself to say that I HAVE appreciated it.\n\nI am going to do \"Used Up\" at Manchester on the 2nd of September. O,\nthink of that!

How can I ever say, \"_Dear_ Joe, if\nyou like!\" The voice may fully frame the falsehood, but the heart--the\nheart, Mr. Wurzel--will have no part in it.\n\nMy dear Mary, you do scant justice to Dover. It is not quite a place to\nmy taste, being too bandy (I mean musical, no reference to its legs),\nand infinitely too genteel. But the sea is very fine, and the walks are\nquite remarkable. There are two ways of going to Folkestone, both lovely\nand striking in the highest degree; and there are heights, and downs,\nand country roads, and I don't know what, everywhere.\n\nTo let you into a secret, I am not quite sure that I ever did like, or\never shall like, anything quite so well as \"Copperfield.\" But I foresee,\nI think, some very good things in \"Bleak House.\" I shouldn't wonder if\nthey were the identical things that D'Israeli sees looming in the\ndistance.

And if it be a consolation to us to know the\nvirtues of his character, and the reasons that we had for loving him, O\nhow much greater is your comfort who were so devoted to him, and were\nthe happiness of his life!\n\nWe have thought of you every day and every hour; we think of you now in\nthe dear old house, and know how right it is, for his dear children's\nsake, that you should have bravely set up your rest in the place\nconsecrated by their father's memory, and within the same summer shadows\nthat fall upon his grave. We try to look on, through a few years, and to\nsee the children brightening it, and George a comfort and a pride and an\nhonour to you; and although it _is_ hard to think of what we have lost,\nwe know how something of it will be restored by your example and\nendeavours, and the blessing that will descend upon them. We know how\nthe time will come when some reflection of that cordial, unaffected,\nmost affectionate presence, which we can never forget, and never would\nforget if we could--such is God's great mercy--will shine out of your\nboy's eyes upon you, his best friend and his last consoler, and fill the\nvoid there is now.\n\nMay God, who has received into His rest through this affliction as good\na man as ever I can know and love and mourn for on this earth, be good\nto you, dear friends, through these coming years! May all those\ncompassionate and hopeful lessons of the great Teacher who shed divine\ntears for the dead bring their full comfort to you! I have no fear of\nthat, my confidence is certainty.\n\nI cannot write what I wish; I had so many things to say, I seem to have\nsaid none. It is so with the remembrances we send. I cannot put them\ninto words.\n\nIf you should ever set up a record in the little church, I would try to\nword it myself, and God knows out of the fulness of my heart, if you\nshould think it well.\n\n                My dear Friend,\n                        Yours, with the truest affection and sympathy.",

The many happy days we have\npassed together came crowding back; all the old cheerful times arose\nbefore us; and the remembrance of what we had loved so dearly and seen\nunder so many aspects--all natural and delightful and affectionate and\never to be cherished--was, how pathetic and touching you know best!\n\nBut my dear, dear Macready, this is not the first time you have felt\nthat the recollection of great love and happiness associated with the\ndead soothes while it wounds. And while I can imagine that the blank\nbeside you may grow wider every day for many days to come, I _know_--I\nthink--that from its depths such comfort will arise as only comes to\ngreat hearts like yours, when they can think upon their trials with a\nsteady trust in God.\n\nMy dear friend, I have known her so well, have been so happy in her\nregard, have been so light-hearted with her, have interchanged so many\ntender remembrances of you with her when you were far away, and have\nseen her ever so simply and truly anxious to be worthy of you, that I\ncannot write as I would and as I know I ought. As I would press your\nhand in your distress, I let this note go from me. I understand your\ngrief, I deeply feel the reason that there is for it, yet in that very\nfeeling find a softening consolation that must spring up a\nhundred-thousandfold for you. May Heaven prosper it in your breast, and\nthe spirits that have gone before, from the regions of mercy to which\nthey have been called, smooth the path you have to tread alone! Children\nare left you. Your good sister (God bless her!) is by your side. You\nhave devoted friends, and more reasons than most men to be self-reliant\nand stedfast. Something is gone that never in this world can be\nreplaced, but much is left, and it is a part of her life, her death, her\nimmortality.\n\nCatherine and Georgina, who are with me here, send you their overflowing\nlove and sympathy. We hope that in a little while, and for a little\nwhile at least, you will come among us, who have known the happiness of\nbeing in this bond with you, and will not exclude us from participation\nin your past and future.\n\n        Ever, my dearest Macready, with unchangeable affection,\n                                          Yours in all love and truth.",

The greater part of them are at a\nmiserable discount (horse-racing excepted, which has been already\nsufficiently done in H. W.), and there is no reason for running amuck at\nthem at all.

WATSON,\n\nHaving just now finished my work for the time being, I turn in here in\nthe course of a rainy walk, to have the gratification of writing a few\nlines to you. If my occupations with this same right hand were less\nnumerous, you would soon be tired of me, I should write to you so often.\n\nYou asked Catherine a question about \"Bleak House.\" Its circulation is\nhalf as large again as \"Copperfield\"! I have just now come to the point\nI have been patiently working up to in the writing, and I hope it will\nsuggest to you a pretty and affecting thing. In the matter of \"Uncle\nTom's Cabin,\" I partly though not entirely agree with Mr. James. No\ndoubt a much lower art will serve for the handling of such a subject in\nfiction, than for a launch on the sea of imagination without such a\npowerful bark; but there are many points in the book very admirably\ndone. There is a certain St. Clair, a New Orleans gentleman, who seems\nto me to be conceived with great power and originality. If he had not \"a\nGrecian outline of face,\" which I began to be a little tired of in my\nearliest infancy, I should think him unexceptionable. He has a sister\ntoo, a maiden lady from New England, in whose person the besetting\nweaknesses and prejudices of the Abolitionists themselves, on the\nsubject of the blacks, are set forth in the liveliest and truest colours\nand with the greatest boldness.\n\nI have written for \"Household Words\" of this next publication-day an\narticle on the State funeral,[14] showing why I consider it altogether a\nmistake, to be temperately but firmly objected to; which I daresay will\nmake a good many of the admirers of such things highly indignant. It may\nhave right and reason on its side, however, none the less.\n\nCharley and I had a great talk at Dover about his going into the army,\nwhen I thought it right to set before him fairly and faithfully the\nobjections to that career, no less than its advantages. The result was\nthat he asked in a very manly way for time to consider. So I appointed\nto go down to Eton on a certain day at the beginning of this month, and\nresume the subject. We resumed it accordingly at the White Hart, at\nWindsor, and he came to the conclusion that he would rather be a\nmerchant, and try to establish some good house of business, where he\nmight find a path perhaps for his younger brothers, and stay at home,\nand make himself the head of that long, small procession. I was very\nmuch pleased with him indeed; he showed a fine sense and a fine feeling\nin the whole matter. We have arranged, therefore, that he shall leave\nEton at Christmas, and go to Germany after the holidays, to become well\nacquainted with that language, now most essential in such a walk of life\nas he will probably tread.\n\nAnd I think this is the whole of my news. We are always talking of you\nat home. Mary Boyle dined with us a little while ago. You look out, I\nimagine, on a waste of water. When I came from Windsor, I thought I must\nhave made a mistake and got into a boat (in the dark) instead of a\nrailway-carriage. Catherine and Georgina send their kindest loves. I am\never, with the best and truest wishes of my heart, my dear Mrs. Watson,\n\n                                        Your most affectionate Friend.",

I am not quite so clear of its suiting the\nChristmas number, for this reason. You know what the spirit of the\nChristmas number is. When I suggested the stories being about a\nhighwayman, I got hold of that idea as being an adventurous one,\nincluding various kinds of wrong, expressing a state of society no\nlonger existing among us, and pleasant to hear (therefore) from an old\nman. Now, your highwayman not being a real highwayman after all, the\nkind of suitable Christmas interest I meant to awaken in the story is\nnot in it. Do you understand? For an ordinary number it is quite\nunobjectionable. If you should think of any other idea, narratable by an\nold man, which you think would strike the chord of the season; and if\nyou should find time to work it out during the short remainder of this\nmonth, I should be greatly pleased to have it. In any case, this story\ngoes straightway into type.\n\nWhat tremendous weather it is! Our best loves to all at home. (I have\njust bought thirty bottles of the most stunning port on earth, which\nEllis of the Star and Garter, Richmond, wrote to me of.)\n\nI think you will find some good going in the next \"Bleak House.\" I write\nshortly, having been working my head off.\n\n                                            Ever affectionately yours.",

Pray decide to do it. Send the papers, as you write\nthem, to me. Meanwhile I will think of a name for them, and bring it to\nbear upon yours, if I think yours improvable. I am sure you may rely on\nbeing widely understood and sympathised with.\n\nForget that I called those two women my dear friends! Why, if I told you\na fiftieth part of what I have thought about them, you would write me\nthe most suspicious of notes, refusing to receive the fiftieth part of\nthat. So I don't write, particularly as you laid your injunctions on me\nconcerning Ruth. In revenge, I will now mention one word that I wish you\nwould take out whenever you reprint that book. She would never--I am\nready to make affidavit before any authority in the land--have called\nher seducer \"Sir,\" when they were living at that hotel in Wales. A girl\npretending to be what she really was would have done it, but she--never!\n\n                                           Ever most faithfully yours.",

I think I must have been quite\n_bouleverse_ by your supposing (as you pretended to do, when you went\naway) that it was not a great pleasure and delight to me to see you act!\n\nThere is a certain Miss Kelly, now sixty-two years old, who was once one\nof the very best of English actresses, in the greater and better days of\nthe English theatre. She has much need of a benefit, and I am exerting\nmyself to arrange one for her, on about the 9th of June, if possible, at\nthe St. James's Theatre. The first piece will be an entertainment of her\nown, and she will act in the last. Between these two (and at the best\ntime of the night), it would be a great attraction to the public, and a\ngreat proof of friendship to me, if you would act. If we could manage,\nthrough your influence and with your assistance, to present a little\nFrench vaudeville, such as \"_Le bon Homme jadis_,\" it would make the\nnight a grand success.\n\nMitchell's permission, I suppose, would be required. That I will\nundertake to apply for, if you will tell me that you are willing to help\nus, and that you could answer for the other necessary actors in the\nlittle French piece, whatever the piece might be, that you would choose\nfor the purpose. Pray write me a short note in answer, on this point.\n\nI ought to tell you that the benefit will be \"under distinguished\npatronage.\" The Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Leinster, the Duke of\nBeaufort, etc. etc., are members of the committee with me, and I have no\ndoubt that the audience will be of the _elite_.\n\nI have asked Mr. Chapman to come to me to-morrow, to arrange for the\nhiring of the theatre. Mr. Harley (a favourite English comedian whom you\nmay know) is our secretary.

Pray assure her of my cordial sympathy and remembrance, and of\nmy earnest desire to do anything in my power to help to put her mind at\nease.\n\nWe are living in a beautiful little country place here, where I have\nbeen hard at work ever since I came, and am now (after an interval of a\nweek's rest) going to work again to finish \"Bleak House.\" Kate and\nGeorgina send their kindest loves to you, and Miss Macready, and all the\nrest. They look forward, I assure you, to their Sherborne visit, when\nI--a mere forlorn wanderer--shall be roaming over the Alps into Italy.

Queen Elizabeth, too, in the profound and impenetrable\ndisguise of a black velvet mask, two inches deep by three broad,\nfollowing him into taverns and worse places, and enquiring of persons of\ndoubtful reputation for \"the sublime Williams,\" was inexpressibly\nridiculous.

WATSON,\n\nI received your letter--most welcome and full of interest to me--when I\nwas hard at work finishing \"Bleak House.\" We are always talking of you;\nand I had said but the day before, that one of the first things I would\ndo on my release would be to write to you. To finish the topic of \"Bleak\nHouse\" at once, I will only add that I like the conclusion very much\nand think it _very pretty indeed_. The story has taken extraordinarily,\nespecially during the last five or six months, when its purpose has been\ngradually working itself out. It has retained its immense circulation\nfrom the first, beating dear old \"Copperfield\" by a round ten thousand\nor more. I have never had so many readers. We had a little reading of\nthe final double number here the night before last, and it made a great\nimpression I assure you.\n\nWe are all extremely well, and like Boulogne very much indeed. I laid\ndown the rule before we came, that we would know nobody here, and we\n_do_ know nobody here. We evaded callers as politely as we could, and\ngradually came to be understood and left to ourselves. It is a fine\nbracing air, a beautiful open country, and an admirable mixture of town\nand country. We live on a green hill-side out of the town, but are in\nthe town (on foot) in ten minutes. Things are tolerably cheap, and\nexceedingly good; the people very cheerful, good-looking, and obliging;\nthe houses very clean; the distance to London short, and easily\ntraversed. I think if you came to know the place (which I never did\nmyself until last October, often as I have been through it), you could\nbe but in one mind about it.\n\nCharley is still at Leipzig. I shall take him up somewhere on the Rhine,\nto bring him home for Christmas, as I come back on my own little tour.\nHe has been in the Hartz Mountains on a walking tour, and has written a\njournal thereof, which he has sent home in portions. It has cost about\nas much in postage as would have bought a pair of ponies.\n\nI contemplate starting from here on Monday, the 10th of October;\nCatherine, Georgina, and the rest of them will then go home. I shall go\nfirst by Paris and Geneva to Lausanne, for it has a separate place in my\nmemory. If the autumn should be very fine (just possible after such a\nsummer), I shall then go by Chamonix and Martigny, over the Simplon to\nMilan, thence to Genoa, Leghorn, Pisa, and Naples, thence, I hope, to\nSicily. Back by Bologna, Florence, Rome, Verona, Mantua, etc., to\nVenice, and home by Germany, arriving in good time for Christmas Day.\nThree nights in Christmas week, I have promised to read in the Town Hall\nat Birmingham, for the benefit of a new and admirable institution for\nworking men projected there. The Friday will be the last night, and I\nshall read the \"Carol\" to two thousand working people, stipulating that\nthey shall have that night entirely to themselves.\n\nIt just occurs to me that I mean to engage, for the two months odd, a\ntravelling servant. I have not yet got one. If you should happen to be\ninterested in any good foreigner, well acquainted with the countries and\nthe languages, who would like such a master, how delighted I should be\nto like _him_!\n\nEver since I have been here, I have been very hard at work, often\ngetting up at daybreak to write through many hours. I have never had the\nleast return of illness, thank God, though I was so altered (in a week)\nwhen I came here, that I doubt if you would have known me. I am redder\nand browner than ever at the present writing, with the addition of a\nrather formidable and fierce moustache. Lowestoft I know, by walking\nover there from Yarmouth, when I went down on an exploring expedition,\nprevious to \"Copperfield.\" It is a fine place. I saw the name\n\"Blunderstone\" on a direction-post between it and Yarmouth, and took it\nfrom the said direction-post for the book. We imagined the Captain's\necstasies when we saw the birth of his child in the papers. In some of\nthe descriptions of Chesney Wold, I have taken many bits, chiefly about\ntrees and shadows, from observations made at Rockingham. I wonder\nwhether you have ever thought so! I shall hope to hear from you again\nsoon, and shall not fail to write again before I go away. There seems to\nbe nothing but \"I\" in this letter; but \"I\" know, my dear friend, that\nyou will be more interested in that letter in the present connection,\nthan in any other I could take from the alphabet.\n\nCatherine and Georgina send their kindest loves, and more messages than\nthis little sheet would hold. If I were to give you a hint of what we\nfeel at the sight of your handwriting, and at the receipt of a word from\nyourself about yourself, and the dear boys, and the precious little\ngirls, I should begin to be sorrowful, which is rather the tendency of\nmy mind at the close of another long book. I heard from Cerjat two or\nthree days since. Goff, by-the-bye, lived in this house two years.\n\n                Ever, my dear Mrs. Watson,\n                                Yours, with true affection and regard.",

I\nbelieve he has told you already that I wrote to him from Boulogne, not\nknowing what to do, as I had not received the precious volume, and\nfeared you might have some plan of sending it to me, with which my\npremature writing would interfere.\n\nYou know how heartily and inexpressibly I prize what you have written to\nme, or you never would have selected me for such a distinction. I could\nnever thank you enough, my dear Landor, and I will not thank you in\nwords any more. Believe me, I receive the dedication like a great\ndignity, the worth of which I hope I thoroughly know. The Queen could\ngive me none in exchange that I wouldn't laughingly snap my fingers at.\n\nWe are staying at Boulogne until the 10th of October, when I go into\nItaly until Christmas, and the rest come home.\n\nKate and Georgina would send you their best loves if they were here, and\nwould never leave off talking about it if I went back and told them I\nhad written to you without such mention of them. Walter is a very good\nboy, and comes home from school with honourable commendation. He passed\nlast Sunday in solitary confinement (in a bath-room) on bread and water,\nfor terminating a dispute with the nurse by throwing a chair in her\ndirection. It is the very first occasion of his ever having got into\ntrouble, for he is a great favourite with the whole house, and one of\nthe most amiable boys in the boy world. (He comes out on birthdays in a\nblaze of shirt-pin).\n\nIf I go and look at your old house, as I shall if I go to Florence, I\nshall bring you back another leaf from the same tree as I plucked the\nlast from.\n\n                         Ever, my dear Landor,\n                                    Heartily and affectionately yours.",

He offered to recommend another,\nbut I had several applicants, and begged Mr. Wills to hold a grand\nreview at the \"Household Words\" office, and select the man who is to\nbring me down as his victim. I am extremely sorry the man you recommend\nwas not to be had. I should have been so delighted to take him.\n\nI am finishing \"The Child's History,\" and clearing the way through\n\"Household Words,\" in general, before I go on my trip. I forget whether\nI told you that Mr. Egg the painter and Mr. Collins are going with me.\nThe other day I was in town. In case you should not have heard of the\ncondition of that deserted village, I think it worth mentioning. All the\nstreets of any note were unpaved, mountains high, and all the omnibuses\nwere sliding down alleys, and looking into the upper windows of small\nhouses. At eleven o'clock one morning I was positively _alone_ in Bond\nStreet. I went to one of my tailors, and he was at Brighton. A\nsmutty-faced woman among some gorgeous regimentals, half finished, had\nnot the least idea when he would be back. I went to another of my\ntailors, and he was in an upper room, with open windows and surrounded\nby mignonette boxes, playing the piano in the bosom of his family. I\nwent to my hosier's, and two of the least presentable of \"the young men\"\nof that elegant establishment were playing at draughts in the back shop.\n(Likewise I beheld a porter-pot hastily concealed under a Turkish\ndressing-gown of a golden pattern.) I then went wandering about to look\nfor some ingenious portmanteau, and near the corner of St. James's\nStreet saw a solitary being sitting in a trunk-shop, absorbed in a book\nwhich, on a close inspection, I found to be \"Bleak House.\" I thought\nthis looked well, and went in. And he really was more interested in\nseeing me, when he knew who I was, than any face I had seen in any\nhouse, every house I knew being occupied by painters, including my own.\nI went to the Athenaeum that same night, to get my dinner, and it was\nshut up for repairs. I went home late, and had forgotten the key and was\nlocked out.\n\nPreparations were made here, about six weeks ago, to receive the\nEmperor, who is not come yet. Meanwhile our countrymen (deluded in the\nfirst excitement) go about staring at these arrangements, with a\npersonal injury upon them which is most ridiculous. And they _will_\npersist in speaking an unknown tongue to the French people, who _will_\nspeak English to them.\n\nKate and Georgina send their kindest loves. We are all quite well. Going\nto drop two small boys here, at school with a former Eton tutor highly\nrecommended to me. Charley was heard of a day or two ago. He says his\nprofessor \"is very short-sighted, always in green spectacles, always\ndrinking weak beer, always smoking a pipe, and always at work.\" The last\nqualification seems to appear to Charley the most astonishing one.\n\n                        Ever, my dear Mrs. Watson,\n                                            Most affectionately yours.",

We live at the\ntop of this immense house, overlooking the port and sea, pleasantly and\nairily enough, though it is no joke to get so high, and though the\napartment is rather vast and faded.\n\nThe old walks are pretty much the same as ever, except that they have\nbuilt behind the Peschiere on the San Bartolomeo hill, and changed the\nwhole town towards San Pietro d'Arena, where we seldom went. The Bisagno\nlooks just the same, strong just now, and with very little water in it.\nVicoli stink exactly as they used to, and are fragrant with the same old\nflavour of very rotten cheese kept in very hot blankets. The Mezzaro\npervades them as before. The old Jesuit college in the Strada Nuova is\nunder the present government the Hotel de Ville, and a very splendid\ncaffe with a terrace garden has arisen between it and Palavicini's old\npalace. Another new and handsome caffe has been built in the Piazza\nCarlo Felice, between the old caffe of the Bei Arti (where Fletcher\nstopped for the bouquets in the green times, when we went to the ----'s\nparty), and the Strada Carlo Felice. The old beastly gate and guardhouse\non the Albaro road are still in their dear old beastly state, and the\nwhole of that road is just as it was. The man without legs is still in\nthe Strada Nuova; but the beggars in general are all cleared off, and\nour old one-armed Belisario made a sudden evaporation a year or two ago.\nI am going to the Peschiere to-day. The puppets are here, and the opera\nis open, but only with a buffo company, and without a buffet. We went to\nthe Scala, where they did an opera of Verdi's, called \"Il Trovatore,\"\nand a poor enough ballet. The whole performance miserable indeed.

Going aboard that morning at half-past nine, we\nfound the steamer more than full of passengers from Marseilles, and in a\nstate of confusion not to be described. We could get no places at the\ntable, got our dinners how we could on deck, had no berths or sleeping\naccommodation of any kind, and had paid heavy first-class fares! To add\nto this, we got to Leghorn too late to steam away again that night,\ngetting the ship's papers examined first--as the authorities said so,\nnot being favourable to the new express English ship, English\nofficered--and we lay off the lighthouse all night long. The scene on\nboard beggars description. Ladies on the tables, gentlemen under the\ntables, and ladies and gentlemen lying indiscriminately on the open\ndeck, arrayed like spoons on a sideboard. No mattresses, no blankets,\nnothing. Towards midnight, attempts were made by means of an awning and\nflags to make this latter scene remotely approach an Australian\nencampment; and we three lay together on the bare planks covered with\novercoats. We were all gradually dozing off when a perfectly tropical\nrain fell, and in a moment drowned the whole ship. The rest of the night\nwas passed upon the stairs, with an immense jumble of men and women.\nWhen anybody came up for any purpose we all fell down; and when anybody\ncame down we all fell up again. Still, the good-humour in the English\npart of the passengers was quite extraordinary. There were excellent\nofficers aboard, and the first mate lent me his cabin to wash in in the\nmorning, which I afterwards lent to Egg and Collins. Then we and the\nEmerson Tennents (who were aboard) and the captain, the doctor, and the\nsecond officer went off on a jaunt together to Pisa, as the ship was to\nlie at Leghorn all day.\n\nThe captain was a capital fellow, but I led him, facetiously, such a\nlife all day, that I got almost everything altered at night. Emerson\nTennent, with the greatest kindness, turned his son out of his state\nroom (who, indeed, volunteered to go in the most amiable manner), and I\ngot a good bed there. The store-room down by the hold was opened for Egg\nand Collins, and they slept with the moist sugar, the cheese in cut, the\nspices, the cruets, the apples and pears--in a perfect chandler's shop;\nin company with what the ----'s would call a \"hold gent\"--who had been\nso horribly wet through overnight that his condition frightened the\nauthorities--a cat, and the steward--who dozed in an arm-chair, and all\nnight long fell headforemost, once in every five minutes, on Egg, who\nslept on the counter or dresser. Last night I had the steward's own\ncabin, opening on deck, all to myself. It had been previously occupied\nby some desolate lady, who went ashore at Civita Vecchia. There was\nlittle or no sea, thank Heaven, all the trip; but the rain was heavier\nthan any I have ever seen, and the lightning very constant and vivid. We\nwere, with the crew, some two hundred people; with boats, at the utmost\nstretch, for one hundred, perhaps. I could not help thinking what would\nhappen if we met with any accident; the crew being chiefly Maltese, and\nevidently fellows who would cut off alone in the largest boat on the\nleast alarm. The speed (it being the crack express ship for the India\nmail) very high; also the running through all the narrow rocky channels.\nThank God, however, here we are. Though the more sensible and\nexperienced part of the passengers agreed with me this morning that it\nwas not a thing to try often. We had an excellent table after the first\nday, the best wines and so forth, and the captain and I swore eternal\nfriendship. Ditto the first officer and the majority of the passengers.\nWe got into the bay about seven this morning, but could not land until\nnoon. We towed from Civita Vecchia the entire Greek navy, I believe,\nconsisting of a little brig-of-war, with great guns, fitted as a\nsteamer, but disabled by having burst the bottom of her boiler in her\nfirst run. She was just big enough to carry the captain and a crew of\nsix or so, but the captain was so covered with buttons and gold that\nthere never would have been room for him on board to put these valuables\naway if he hadn't worn them, which he consequently did, all night.\n\nWhenever anything was wanted to be done, as slackening the tow-rope or\nanything of that sort, our officers roared at this miserable potentate,\nin violent English, through a speaking-trumpet, of which he couldn't\nhave understood a word under the most favourable circumstances, so he\ndid all the wrong things first, and the right things always last. The\nabsence of any knowledge of anything not English on the part of the\nofficers and stewards was most ridiculous. I met an Italian gentleman on\nthe cabin steps, yesterday morning, vainly endeavouring to explain that\nhe wanted a cup of tea for his sick wife. And when we were coming out of\nthe harbour at Genoa, and it was necessary to order away that boat of\nmusic you remember, the chief officer (called aft for the purpose, as\n\"knowing something of Italian,\") delivered himself in this explicit and\nclear manner to the principal performer: \"Now, signora, if you don't\nsheer off, you'll be run down; so you had better trice up that guitar of\nyours, and put about.\"\n\nWe get on as well as possible, and it is extremely pleasant and\ninteresting, and I feel that the change is doing me great and real\nservice, after a long continuous strain upon the mind; but I am pleased\nto think that we are at our farthest point, and I look forward with joy\nto coming home again, to my old room, and the old walks, and all the old\npleasant things.\n\nI wish I had arranged, or could have done so--for it would not have been\neasy--to find some letters here. It is a blank to stay for five days in\na place without any.\n\nI don't think Edward knows fifty Italian words; but much more French is\nspoken in Italy now than when we were here, and he stumbles along\nsomehow.\n\nI am afraid this is a dull letter, for I am very tired. You must take\nthe will for the deed, my dear, and good night.\n\n                                             Ever most affectionately.",

I went in an\nopen carriage from the hotel in all state, and the coachman, to my\nsurprise, pulled up at the end of the Chiaja. \"Behold the house,\" says\nhe, \"of Il Signor Larthoor!\"--at the same time pointing with his whip\ninto the seventh heaven, where the early stars were shining. \"But the\nSignor Larthoor,\" returns the Inimitable darling, \"lives at Pausilippo.\"\n\"It is true,\" says the coachman (still pointing to the evening star),\n\"but he lives high up the Salita Sant' Antonio, where no carriage ever\nyet ascended, and that is the house\" (evening star as aforesaid), \"and\none must go on foot. Behold the Salita Sant' Antonio!\" I went up it, a\nmile and a half I should think. I got into the strangest places, among\nthe wildest Neapolitans--kitchens, washing-places, archways, stables,\nvineyards--was baited by dogs, answered in profoundly unintelligible\nNeapolitan, from behind lonely locked doors, in cracked female voices,\nquaking with fear; could hear of no such Englishman or any Englishman.\nBy-and-by I came upon a Polenta-shop in the clouds, where an old\nFrenchman, with an umbrella like a faded tropical leaf (it had not\nrained for six weeks) was staring at nothing at all, with a snuff-box in\nhis hand. To him I appealed concerning the Signor Larthoor. \"Sir,\" said\nhe, with the sweetest politeness, \"can you speak French?\" \"Sir,\" said I,\n\"a little.\" \"Sir,\" said he, \"I presume the Signor Loothere\"--you will\nobserve that he changed the name according to the custom of his\ncountry--\"is an Englishman.\" I admitted that he was the victim of\ncircumstances and had that misfortune. \"Sir,\" said he, \"one word more.\n_Has_ he a servant with a wooden leg?\" \"Great Heaven, sir,\" said I, \"how\ndo I know! I should think not, but it is possible.\" \"It is always,\" said\nthe Frenchman, \"possible. Almost all the things of the world are always\npossible.\" \"Sir,\" said I--you may imagine my condition and dismal sense\nof my own absurdity, by this time--\"that is true.\" He then took an\nimmense pinch of snuff, wiped the dust off his umbrella, led me to an\narch commanding a wonderful view of the bay of Naples, and pointed deep\ninto the earth from which I had mounted. \"Below there, near the lamp,\none finds an Englishman, with a servant with a wooden leg. It is always\npossible that he is the Signor Loothere.\" I had been asked at six, and\nit was now getting on for seven. I went down again in a state of\nperspiration and misery not to be described, and without the faintest\nhope of finding the place. But as I was going down to the lamp, I saw\nthe strangest staircase up a dark corner, with a man in a\nwhite-waistcoat (evidently hired) standing on the top of it, fuming. I\ndashed in at a venture, found it was the place, made the most of the\nwhole story, and was indescribably popular. The best of it was, that as\nnobody ever did find the place, he had put a servant at the bottom of\nthe Salita, to \"wait for an English gentleman.\" The servant (as he\npresently pleaded), deceived by the moustache, had allowed the English\ngentleman to pass unchallenged.\n\nThe night before we left Naples we were at the San Carlo, where, with\nthe Verdi rage of our old Genoa time, they were again doing the\n\"Trovatore.\" It seemed rubbish on the whole to me, but was very fairly\ndone. I think \"La Tenco,\" the prima donna, will soon be a great hit in\nLondon. She is a very remarkable singer and a fine actress, to the best\nof my judgment on such premises. There seems to be no opera here, at\npresent. There was a Festa in St. Peter's to-day, and the Pope passed to\nthe Cathedral in state. We were all there.\n\nWe leave here, please God, on Friday morning, and post to Florence in\nthree days and a half. We came here by Vetturino. Upon the whole, the\nroadside inns are greatly improved since our time. Half-past three and\nhalf-past four have been, however, our usual times of rising on the\nroad.\n\nI was in my old place at the Coliseum this morning, and it was as grand\nas ever. With that exception the ruined part of Rome--the real original\nRome--looks smaller than my remembrance made it. It is the only place on\nwhich I have yet found that effect. We are in the old hotel.\n\nYou are going to Bonchurch I suppose? will be there, perhaps, when this\nletter reaches you? I shall be pleased to think of you as at home again,\nand making the commodious family mansion look natural and home-like. I\ndon't like to think of my room without anybody to peep into it now and\nthen. Here is a world of travelling arrangements for me to settle, and\nhere are Collins and Egg looking sideways at me with an occasional\nimploring glance as beseeching me to settle it. So I leave off.\nGood-night.\n\n                          Ever, my dearest Georgy,\n                                            Most affectionately yours.",

It is a very clean, large, bright-looking house at the corner of\nthe Via Gregoriana; not exactly in a part of Rome I should pick out for\nliving in, and on what I should be disposed to call the wrong side of\nthe street. However, this is not to the purpose. Signor Dies has no idea\nof letting an apartment for a short time--scouted the idea of a\nmonth--signified that he could not be brought to the contemplation of\ntwo months--was by no means clear that he could come down to the\nconsideration of three. This of course settled the business speedily.\n\nThis hotel is no longer kept by the Melloni I spoke of, but is even\nbetter kept than in his time, and is a very admirable house. I have\nengaged a small apartment for you to be ready on Thursday afternoon (at\ntwo piastres and a half--two-and-a-half per day--sitting-room and three\nbedrooms, one double-bedded and two not). If you would like to change to\nours, which is a very good one, on Friday morning, you can of course do\nso. As our dining-room is large, and there is no table d'hote here, I\nwill order dinner in it for our united parties at six on Thursday. You\nwill be able to decide how to arrange for the remainder of your stay,\nafter being here and looking about you--two really necessary\nconsiderations in Rome.\n\nPray make my kind regards to Lady Tennent, and Miss Tennent, and your\ngood son, who became homeless for my sake. Mr. Egg and Mr. Collins\ndesire to be also remembered.\n\nIt has been beautiful weather since we left Naples, until to-day, when\nit rains in a very dogged, sullen, downcast, and determined manner. We\nhave been speculating at breakfast on the possibility of its raining in\na similar manner at Naples, and of your wandering about the hotel,\nrefusing consolation.\n\nI grieve to report the Orvieto considerably damaged by the general vine\nfailure, but still far from despicable. Montefiascone (the Est wine you\nknow) is to be had here; and we have had one bottle in the very finest\ncondition, and one in a second-rate state.\n\nThe Coliseum, in its magnificent old decay, is as grand as ever; and\nwith the electric telegraph darting through one of its ruined arches\nlike a sunbeam and piercing direct through its cruel old heart, is even\ngrander.\n\n                             Believe me always, very faithfully yours.",

This morning, on sending again to the post-office, I at\nlast got yours, and most welcome it is with all its contents.\n\nI found Layard at Naples, who went up Vesuvius with us, and was very\nmerry and agreeable. He is travelling with Lord and Lady Somers, and\nLord Somers being laid up with an attack of malaria fever, Layard had a\nday to spare. Craven, who was Lord Normanby's Secretary of Legation in\nParis, now lives at Naples, and is married to a French lady. He is very\nhospitable and hearty, and seemed to have vague ideas that something\nmight be done in a pretty little private theatre he has in his house. He\ntold me of Fanny Kemble and the Sartoris's being here. I have also heard\nof Thackeray's being here--I don't know how truly. Lockhart is here,\nand, I fear, very ill. I mean to go and see him.\n\nWe are living in the old hotel, which is not now kept by Meloni, who has\nretired. I don't know whether you recollect an apartment at the top of\nthe house, to which we once ran up with poor Roche to see the horses\nstart in the race at the Carnival time? That is ours, in which I at\npresent write. We have a large back dining-room, a handsome front\ndrawing-room, looking into the Piazza del Popolo, and three front\nbedrooms, all on a floor. The whole costs us about four shillings a day\neach. The hotel is better kept than ever. There is a little kitchen to\neach apartment where the dinner is kept hot. There is no house\ncomparable to it in Paris, and it is better than Mivart's. We start for\nFlorence, post, on Friday morning, and I am bargaining for a carriage to\ntake us on to Venice.\n\nEdward is an excellent servant, and always cheerful and ready for his\nwork. He knows no Italian, except the names of a few things, but French\nis far more widely known here now than in our time. Neither is he an\nexperienced courier as to roads and so forth; but he picks up all that I\nwant to know, here and there, somehow or other. I am perfectly pleased\nwith him, and would rather have him than an older hand. Poor dear Roche\ncomes back to my mind though, often.\n\nI have written to engage the courier from Turin into France, from\n_Tuesday, the 6th December_. This will bring us home some two days after\nthe tenth, probably. I wrote to Charley from Naples, giving him his\nchoice of meeting me at Lyons, in Paris, or at Boulogne. I gave him full\ninstructions what to do if he arrived before me, and he will write to me\nat Turin saying where I shall find him. I shall be a day or so later\nthan I supposed as the nearest calculation I could make when I wrote to\nhim; but his waiting for me at an hotel will not matter.\n\nWe have had delightful weather, with one day's exception, until to-day,\nwhen it rained very heavily and suddenly. Egg and Collins have gone to\nthe Vatican, and I am \"going\" to try whether I can hit out anything for\nthe Christmas number. Give my love to Forster, and tell him I won't\nwrite to him until I hear from him.\n\nI have not come across any English whom I know except Layard and the\nEmerson Tennents, who will be here on Thursday from Civita Vecchia, and\nare to dine with us. The losses up to this point have been two pairs of\nshoes (one mine and one Egg's), Collins's snuff-box, and Egg's\ndressing-gown.\n\nWe observe the managerial punctuality in all our arrangements, and have\nnot had any difference whatever.\n\nI have been reserving this side all through my letter, in the conviction\nthat I had something else to tell you. If I had, I cannot remember what\nit is. I introduced myself to Salvatore at Vesuvius, and reminded him of\nthe night when poor Le Gros fell down the mountains. He was full of\ninterest directly, remembered the very hole, put on his gold-banded\ncap, and went up with us himself. He did not know that Le Gros was dead,\nand was very sorry to hear it. He asked after the ladies, and hoped they\nwere very happy, to which I answered, \"Very.\" The cone is completely\nchanged since our visit, is not at all recognisable as the same place;\nand there is no fire from the mountain, though there is a great deal of\nsmoke. Its last demonstration was in 1850.\n\nI shall be glad to think of your all being at home again, as I suppose\nyou will be soon after the receipt of this. Will you see to the\ninvitations for Christmas Day, and write to Laetitia? I shall be very\nhappy to be at home again myself, and to embrace you; for of course I\nmiss you _very much_, though I feel that I could not have done a better\nthing to clear my mind and freshen it up again, than make this\nexpedition. If I find Charley much ahead of me, I shall start on through\na night or so to meet him, and leave the others to catch us up. I look\nupon the journey as almost closed at Turin. My best love to Mamey, and\nKatey, and Sydney, and Harry, and the darling Plornishghenter. We often\ntalk about them, and both my companions do so with interest. They always\nsend all sorts of messages to you, which I never deliver. God bless you!\nTake care of yourself.\n\n                                             Ever most affectionately.",

W.\n\nMY DEAR WILLS,\n\nI sent you by post from Rome, on Wednesday last, a little story for the\nChristmas number, called \"The Schoolboy's Story.\" I have an idea of\nanother short one, to be called \"Nobody's Story,\" which I hope to be\nable to do at Venice, and to send you straight home before this month is\nout. I trust you have received the first safely.\n\nEdward continues to do extremely well. He is always, early and late,\nwhat you have seen him. He is a very steady fellow, a little too bashful\nfor a courier even; settles prices of everything now, as soon as we come\ninto an hotel; and improves fast. His knowledge of Italian is painfully\ndefective, and, in the midst of a howling crowd at a post-house or\nrailway station, this deficiency perfectly stuns him. I was obliged last\nnight to get out of the carriage, and pluck him from a crowd of porters\nwho were putting our baggage into wrong conveyances--by cursing and\nordering about in all directions. I should think about ten substantives,\nthe names of ten common objects, form his whole Italian stock. It\nmatters very little at the hotels, where a great deal of French is\nspoken now; but, on the road, if none of his party knew Italian, it\nwould be a very serious inconvenience indeed.\n\nWill you write to Ryland if you have not heard from him, and ask him\nwhat the Birmingham reading-nights are really to be? For it is\nridiculous enough that I positively don't know. Can't a Saturday Night\nin a Truck District, or a Sunday Morning among the Ironworkers (a fine\nsubject) be knocked out in the course of the same visit?\n\nIf you should see any managing man you know in the Oriental and\nPeninsular Company, I wish you would very gravely mention to him from me\nthat if they are not careful what they are about with their steamship\n_Valetta_, between Marseilles and Naples, they will suddenly find that\nthey will receive a blow one fine day in _The Times_, which it will be\na very hard matter for them ever to recover. When I sailed in her from\nGenoa, there had been taken on board, _with no caution in most cases\nfrom the agent, or hint of discomfort_, at least forty people of both\nsexes for whom there was no room whatever. I am a pretty old traveller\nas you know, but I never saw anything like the manner in which pretty\nwomen were compelled to lie among the men in the great cabin and on the\nbare decks. The good humour was beyond all praise, but the natural\nindignation very great; and I was repeatedly urged to stand up for the\npublic in \"Household Words,\" and to write a plain description of the\nfacts to _The Times_. If I had done either, and merely mentioned that\nall these people paid heavy first-class fares, I will answer for it that\nthey would have been beaten off the station in a couple of months. I did\nneither, because I was the best of friends with the captain and all the\nofficers, and never saw such a fine set of men; so admirable in the\ndischarge of their duty, and so zealous to do their best by everybody.\nIt is impossible to praise them too highly. But there is a strong desire\nat all the ports along the coast to throw impediments in the way of the\nEnglish service, and to favour the French and Italian boats. In those\nboats (which I know very well) great care is taken of the passengers,\nand the accommodation is very good. If the Peninsula and Oriental add to\nall this the risk of such an exposure as they are _certain_ to get (if\nthey go on so) in _The Times_, they are dead sure to get a blow from the\npublic which will make them stagger again. I say nothing of the number\nof the passengers and the room in the ship's boats, though the frightful\nconsideration the contrast presented must have been in more minds than\nmine. I speak only of the taking people for whom there is no sort of\naccommodation as the most decided swindle, and the coolest, I ever did\nwith my eyes behold.\n\n        Kindest regards from fellow-travellers.\n                                Ever, my dear Wills, faithfully yours.",

We travelled post with four horses all the way\n(from Padua to this place there is a railroad) and travelled all night.\nWe left Florence at half-past six in the morning, and got to Padua at\neleven next day--yesterday. The cold at night was most intense. I don't\nthink I have ever felt it colder. But our carriage was very comfortable,\nand we had some wine and some rum to keep us warm. We came by Bologna\n(where we had tea) and Ferrara. You may imagine the delays in the night\nwhen I tell you that each of our passports, after receiving _six vises_\nat Florence, received in the course of the one night, _nine more_, every\none of which was written and sealed; somebody being slowly knocked out\nof bed to do it every time! It really was excruciating.\n\nLandor had sent me a letter to his son, and on the day before we left\nFlorence I thought I would go out to Fiesoli and leave it. So I got a\nlittle one-horse open carriage and drove off alone. We were within half\na mile of the Villa Landoro, and were driving down a very narrow lane\nlike one of those at Albaro, when I saw an elderly lady coming towards\nus, very well dressed in silk of the Queen's blue, and walking freshly\nand briskly against the wind at a good round pace. It was a bright,\ncloudless, very cold day, and I thought she walked with great spirit, as\nif she enjoyed it. I also thought (perhaps that was having him in my\nmind) that her ruddy face was shaped like Landor's. All of a sudden the\ncoachman pulls up, and looks enquiringly at me. \"What's the matter?\"\nsays I. \"Ecco la Signora Landoro?\" says he. \"For the love of Heaven,\ndon't stop,\" says I. \"_I_ don't know her, I am only going to the house\nto leave a letter--go on!\" Meanwhile she (still coming on) looked at me,\nand I looked at her, and we were both a good deal confused, and so went\nour several ways. Altogether, I think it was as disconcerting a meeting\nas I ever took part in, and as odd a one. Under any other circumstances\nI should have introduced myself, but the separation made the\ncircumstances so peculiar that \"I didn't like.\"\n\nThe Plornishghenter is evidently the greatest, noblest, finest,\ncleverest, brightest, and most brilliant of boys. Your account of him is\nmost delightful, and I hope to find another letter from you somewhere on\nthe road, making me informed of his demeanour on your return. On which\noccasion, as on every other, I have no doubt he will have distinguished\nhimself as an irresistibly attracting, captivating May-Roon-Ti-Groon-Ter.\nGive him a good many kisses for me. I quite agree with Syd as to his\nideas of paying attention to the old gentleman. It's not bad, but\ndeficient in originality. The usual deficiency of an inferior intellect\nwith so great a model before him. I am very curious to see whether the\nPlorn remembers me on my reappearance.\n\nI meant to have gone to work this morning, and to have tried a second\nlittle story for the Christmas number of \"Household Words,\" but my\nletters have (most pleasantly) put me out, and I defer all such wise\nefforts until to-morrow. Egg and Collins are out in a gondola with a\nservitore di piazza.\n\nYou will find this but a stupid letter, but I really have no news. We go\nto the opera, whenever there is one, see sights, eat and drink, sleep\nin a natural manner two or three nights, and move on again. Edward was a\nlittle crushed at Padua yesterday. He had been extraordinarily cold all\nnight in the rumble, and had got out our clothes to dress, and I think\nmust have been projecting a five or six hours' sleep, when I announced\nthat he was to come on here in an hour and a half to get the rooms and\norder dinner. He fell into a sudden despondency of the profoundest kind,\nbut was quite restored when we arrived here between eight and nine. We\nfound him waiting at the Custom House with a gondola in his usual brisk\ncondition.\n\nIt is extraordinary how few English we see. With the exception of a\ngentlemanly young fellow (in a consumption I am afraid), married to the\ntiniest little girl, in a brown straw hat, and travelling with his\nsister and her sister, and a consumptive single lady, travelling with a\nmaid and a Scotch terrier christened Trotty Veck, we have scarcely seen\nany, and have certainly spoken to none, since we left Switzerland. These\nwere aboard the _Valetta_, where the captain and I indulged in all\nmanner of insane suppositions concerning the straw hat--the \"Little\nMatron\" we called her; by which name she soon became known all over the\nship. The day we entered Rome, and the moment we entered it, there was\nthe Little Matron, alone with antiquity--and Murray--on the wall. The\nvery first church I entered, there was the Little Matron. On the last\nafternoon, when I went alone to St. Peter's, there was the Little Matron\nand her party. The best of it is, that I was extremely intimate with\nthem, invited them to Tavistock House, when they come home in the\nspring, and have not the faintest idea of their name.\n\nThere was no table d'hote at Rome, or at Florence, but there is one\nhere, and we dine at it to-day, so perhaps we may stumble upon\nsomebody. I have heard from Charley this morning, who appoints (wisely)\nParis as our place of meeting. I had a letter from Coote, at Florence,\ninforming me that his volume of \"Household Songs\" was ready, and\nrequesting permission to dedicate it to me. Which of course I gave.\n\nI am beginning to think of the Birmingham readings. I suppose you won't\nobject to be taken to hear them? This is the last place at which we\nshall make a stay of more than one day. We shall stay at Parma one, and\nat Turin one, supposing De la Rue to have been successful in taking\nplaces with the courier into France for the day on which we want them\n(he was to write to bankers at Turin to do it), and then we shall come\nhard and fast home. I feel almost there already, and shall be delighted\nto close the pleasant trip, and get back to my own Piccola Camera--if,\nbeing English, you understand what _that_ is. My best love and kisses to\nMamey, Katey, Sydney, Harry, and the noble Plorn. Last, not least, to\nyourself, and many of them.

WATSON,\n\nOn the very day after I sent the Christmas number to Rockingham, I heard\nof your being at Brighton. I should have sent another there, but that I\nhad a misgiving I might seem to be making too much of it. For, when I\nthought of the probability of the Rockingham copy going on to Brighton,\nand pictured to myself the advent of two of those very large envelopes\nat once at Junction House at breakfast time, a sort of comic modesty\novercame me. I was heartily pleased with the Birmingham audience, which\nwas a very fine one. I never saw, nor do I suppose anybody ever did,\nsuch an interesting sight as the working people's night. There were two\nthousand five hundred of them there, and a more delicately observant\naudience it is impossible to imagine. They lost nothing, misinterpreted\nnothing, followed everything closely, laughed and cried with most\ndelightful earnestness, and animated me to that extent that I felt as if\nwe were all bodily going up into the clouds together. It is an enormous\nplace for the purpose; but I had considered all that carefully, and I\nbelieve made the most distant person hear as well as if I had been\nreading in my own room. I was a little doubtful before I began on the\nfirst night whether it was quite practicable to conceal the requisite\neffort; but I soon had the satisfaction of finding that it was, and that\nwe were all going on together, in the first page, as easily, to all\nappearance, as if we had been sitting round the fire.\n\nI am obliged to go out on Monday at five and to dine out; but I will be\nat home at any time before that hour that you may appoint. You say you\nare only going to stay one night in town; but if you could stay two, and\nwould dine with us alone on Tuesday, _that_ is the plan that we should\nall like best. Let me have one word from you by post on Monday morning.\nFew things that I saw, when I was away, took my fancy so much as the\nElectric Telegraph, piercing, like a sunbeam, right through the cruel\nold heart of the Coliseum at Rome. And on the summit of the Alps, among\nthe eternal ice and snow, there it was still, with its posts sustained\nagainst the sweeping mountain winds by clusters of great beams--to say\nnothing of its being at the bottom of the sea as we crossed the Channel.\nWith kindest loves,\n\n                             Ever, my dear Mrs. Watson,\n                                                Most faithfully yours.",

The accused pleads guilty, but throws himself upon the mercy of\nthe court. He humbly represents that his usual hour for getting up, in\nthe course of his travels, was three o'clock in the morning, and his\nusual hour for going to bed, nine or ten the next night. That the places\nin which he chiefly deviated from these rules of hardship, were Rome and\nVenice; and that at those cities of fame he shut himself up in solitude,\nand wrote Christmas papers for the incomparable publication known as\n\"Household Words.\" That his correspondence at all times, arising out of\nthe business of the said \"Household Words\" alone, was very heavy. That\nhis offence, though undoubtedly committed, was unavoidable, and that a\nnominal punishment will meet the justice of the case.\n\nWe had only three bad days out of the whole time. After Naples, which\nwas very hot, we had very cold, clear, bright weather. When we got to\nChamounix, we found the greater part of the inns shut up and the people\ngone. No visitors whatsoever, and plenty of snow. These were the very\nbest circumstances under which to see the place, and we stayed a couple\nof days at the Hotel de Londres (hastily re-furbished for our\nentertainment), and climbed through the snow to the Mer de Glace, and\nthoroughly enjoyed it. Then we went, in mule procession (I walking) to\nthe old hotel at Martigny, where Collins was ill, and I suppose I bored\nEgg to death by talking all the evening about the time when you and I\nwere there together. Naples (a place always painful to me, in the\nintense degradation of the people) seems to have only three classes of\ninhabitants left in it--priests, soldiers (standing army one hundred\nthousand strong), and spies. Of macaroni we ate very considerable\nquantities everywhere; also, for the benefit of Italy, we took our share\nof every description of wine. At Naples I found Layard, the Nineveh\ntraveller, who is a friend of mine and an admirable fellow; so we\nfraternised and went up Vesuvius together, and ate more macaroni and\ndrank more wine. At Rome, the day after our arrival, they were making a\nsaint at St. Peter's; on which occasion I was surprised to find what an\nimmense number of pounds of wax candles it takes to make the regular,\ngenuine article. From Turin to Paris, over the Mont Cenis, we made only\none journey. The Rhone, being frozen and foggy, was not to be navigated,\nso we posted from Lyons to Chalons, and everybody else was doing the\nlike, and there were no horses to be got, and we were stranded at\nmidnight in amazing little cabarets, with nothing worth mentioning to\neat in them, except the iron stove, which was rusty, and the\nbilliard-table, which was musty. We left Turin on a Tuesday evening, and\narrived in Paris on a Friday evening; where I found my son Charley,\nhot--or I should rather say cold--from Germany, with his arms and legs\nso grown out of his coat and trousers, that I was ashamed of him, and\nwas reduced to the necessity of taking him, under cover of night, to a\nready-made establishment in the Palais Royal, where they put him into\nballoon-waisted pantaloons, and increased my confusion. Leaving Calais\non the evening of Sunday, the 10th of December; fact of distinguished\nauthor's being aboard, was telegraphed to Dover; thereupon authorities\nof Dover Railway detained train to London for distinguished author's\narrival, rather to the exasperation of British public. D. A. arrived at\nhome between ten and eleven that night, thank God, and found all well\nand happy.\n\nI think you see _The Times_, and if so, you will have seen a very\ngraceful and good account of the Birmingham readings. It was the most\nremarkable thing that England could produce, I think, in the way of a\nvast intelligent assemblage; and the success was most wonderful and\nprodigious--perfectly overwhelming and astounding altogether. They wound\nup by giving my wife a piece of plate, having given me one before; and\nwhen you come to dine here (may it be soon!) it shall be duly displayed\nin the centre of the table.\n\nTell Mrs. Cerjat, to whom my love, and all our loves, that I have highly\nexcited them at home here by giving them an account in detail of all\nyour daughters; further, that the way in which Catherine and Georgina\nhave questioned me and cross-questioned me about you all,\nnotwithstanding, is maddening. Mrs. Watson has been obliged to pass her\nChristmas at Brighton alone with her younger children, in consequence of\nher two eldest boys coming home to Rockingham from school with the\nwhooping-cough. The quarantine expires to-day, however; and she drives\nhere, on her way back into Northamptonshire, to-morrow.\n\nThe sad affair of the Preston strike remains unsettled; and I hear, on\nstrong authority, that if that were settled, the Manchester people are\nprepared to strike next. Provisions very dear, but the people very\ntemperate and quiet in general. So ends this jumble, which looks like\nthe index to a chapter in a book, I find, when I read it over.\n\n                           Ever, my dear Cerjat, heartily your Friend.",

The concluding\nnarrative is by far the most meritorious part of the business. Still,\nthe people are so very convulsive and tumble down so many places, and\nare always knocking other people's bones about in such a very irrational\nway, that I object. The way in which earthquakes won't swallow the\nmonsters, and volcanoes in eruption won't boil them, is extremely\naggravating. Also their habit of bolting when they are going to explain\nanything.\n\nYou have sent me a very different and a much better book; and for that I\nam truly grateful. With the dust of \"Maturin\" in my eyes, I sat down and\nread \"The Death of Friends,\" and the dust melted away in some of those\ntears it is good to shed. I remember to have read \"The Backroom Window\"\nsome years ago, and I have associated it with you ever since. It is a\nmost delightful paper. But the two volumes are all delightful, and I\nhave put them on a shelf where you sit down with Charles Lamb again,\nwith Talfourd's vindication of him hard by.\n\nWe never meet. I hope it is not irreligious, but in this strange London\nI have an inclination to adapt a portion of the Church Service to our\ncommon experience.

If you will come and breakfast with me about\nmidnight--anywhere--any day, and go to bed no more until we fly to these\npastoral retreats, I shall be delighted to have so vicious an associate.\n\nWill you undertake to let Ward know that if he still wishes me to sit to\nhim, he shall have me as long as he likes, at Tavistock House, on\nMonday, the 24th, from ten A.M.?\n\nI have made it understood here that we shall want to be taken the\ngreatest care of this summer, and to be fed on nourishing meats. Several\nnew dishes have been rehearsed and have come out very well. I have met\nwith what they call in the City \"a parcel\" of the celebrated 1846\nchampagne. It is a very fine wine, and calculated to do us good when\nweak.\n\nThe camp is about a mile off.

It is so cool that we\nhave not only a fire in the drawing-room regularly, but another to dine\nby. The delicious freshness of the air is charming, and it is generally\nbright and windy besides.\n\nThirdly, that ----'s intellectual faculties appear to have developed\nsuddenly. He has taken to borrowing money; from which I infer (as\nhe has no intention whatever of repaying) that his mental powers are\nof a high order. Having got a franc from me, he fell upon Mrs. Dickens\nfor five sous. She declining to enter into the transaction, he\nbeleaguered that feeble little couple, Harry and Sydney, into paying\ntwo sous each for \"tickets\" to behold the ravishing spectacle of an\nutterly-non-existent-and-there-fore-impossible-to-be-produced toy\ntheatre. He eats stony apples, and harbours designs upon his\nfellow-creatures until he has become light-headed. From the couch\nrendered uneasy by this disorder he has arisen with an excessively\nprotuberant forehead, a dull slow eye, a complexion of a leaden hue, and\na croaky voice. He has become a horror to me, and I resort to the most\ncowardly expedients to avoid meeting him. He, on the other hand, wanting\nanother franc, dodges me round those trees at the corner, and at the\nback door; and I have a presentiment upon me that I shall fall a\nsacrifice to his cupidity at last.\n\nOn the Sunday night after you left, or rather on the Monday morning at\nhalf-past one, Mary was taken _very ill_. English cholera. She was\nsinking so fast, and the sickness was so exceedingly alarming, that it\nevidently would not do to wait for Elliotson. I caused everything to be\ndone that we had naturally often thought of, in a lonely house so full\nof children, and fell back upon the old remedy; though the difficulty of\ngiving even it was rendered very great by the frightful sickness. Thank\nGod, she recovered so favourably that by breakfast time she was fast\nasleep. She slept twenty-four hours, and has never had the least\nuneasiness since. I heard--of course afterwards--that she had had an\nattack of sickness two nights before. I think that long ride and those\nlate dinners had been too much for her. Without them I am inclined to\ndoubt whether she would have been ill.\n\nLast Sunday as ever was, the theatre took fire at half-past eleven in\nthe forenoon. Being close by the English church, it showered hot sparks\ninto that temple through the open windows. Whereupon the congregation\nshrieked and rose and tumbled out into the street; ---- benignly\nobserving to the only ancient female who would listen to him, \"I fear we\nmust part;\" and afterwards being beheld in the street--in his robes and\nwith a kind of sacred wildness on him--handing ladies over the kennel\ninto shops and other structures, where they had no business whatever, or\nthe least desire to go. I got to the back of the theatre, where I could\nsee in through some great doors that had been forced open, and whence\nthe spectacle of the whole interior, burning like a red-hot cavern, was\nreally very fine, even in the daylight. Meantime the soldiers were at\nwork, \"saving\" the scenery by pitching it into the next street; and the\npoor little properties (one spinning-wheel, a feeble imitation of a\nwater-mill, and a basketful of the dismalest artificial flowers very\nconspicuous) were being passed from hand to hand with the greatest\nexcitement, as if they were rescued children or lovely women. In four or\nfive hours the whole place was burnt down, except the outer walls. Never\nin my days did I behold such feeble endeavours in the way of\nextinguishment. On an average I should say it took ten minutes to throw\nhalf a gallon of water on the great roaring heap; and every time it was\ninsulted in this way it gave a ferocious burst, and everybody ran off.\nBeaucourt has been going about for two days in a clean collar; which\nphenomenon evidently means something, but I don't know what. Elliotson\nreports that the great conjuror lives at his hotel, has extra wine every\nday, and fares expensively.

Allow me to thank you for it, in the first\nplace, with great cordiality.\n\nAlthough I cannot say that I came without any prepossessions to the\nperusal of your play (for I had favourable inclinings towards it before\nI began), I _can_ say that I read it with the closest attention, and\nthat it inspired me with a strong interest, and a genuine and high\nadmiration. The parts that involve some of the greatest difficulties of\nyour task appear to me those in which you shine most. I would\nparticularly instance the end of Julia as a very striking example of\nthis. The delicacy and beauty of her redemption from her weak rash\nlover, are very far, indeed beyond the range of any ordinary dramatist,\nand display the true poetical strength.\n\nAs your hopes now centre in Mr. Phelps, and in seeing the child of your\nfancy on his stage, I will venture to point out to you not only what I\ntake to be very dangerous portions of \"Love's Martyrdom\" as it stands,\n_for presentation on the stage_, but portions which I believe Mr. Phelps\nwill speedily regard in that light when he sees it before him in the\npersons of live men and women on the wooden boards. Knowing him, I think\nhe will be then as violently discouraged as he is now generously\nexalted; and it may be useful to you to be prepared for the\nconsideration of those passages.\n\nI do not regard it as a great stumbling-block that the play of modern\ntimes best known to an audience proceeds upon the main idea of this,\nnamely, that there was a hunchback who, because of his deformity,\nmistrusted himself. But it is certainly a grain in the balance when the\nbalance is going the wrong way, and therefore it should be most\ncarefully trimmed. The incident of the ring is an insignificant one to\nlook at over a row of gaslights, is difficult to convey to an audience,\nand the least thing will make it ludicrous. If it be so well done by Mr.\nPhelps himself as to be otherwise than ludicrous, it will be\ndisagreeable. If it be either, it will be perilous, and doubly so,\nbecause you revert to it. The quarrel scene between the two brothers in\nthe third act is now so long that the justification of blind passion and\nimpetuosity--which can alone bear out Franklyn, before the bodily eyes\nof a great concourse of spectators, in plunging at the life of his own\nbrother--is lost. That the two should be parted, and that Franklyn\nshould again drive at him, and strike him, and then wound him, is a\nstate of things to set the sympathy of an audience in the wrong\ndirection, and turn it from the man you make happy to the man you leave\nunhappy. I would on no account allow the artist to appear, attended by\nthat picture, more than once. All the most sudden inconstancy of\nClarence I would soften down. Margaret must act much better than any\nactress I have ever seen, if all her lines fall in pleasant places;\ntherefore, I think she needs compression too.\n\nAll this applies solely to the theatre. If you ever revise the sheets\nfor readers, will you note in the margin the broken laughter and the\nappeals to the Deity? If, on summing them up, you find you want them\nall, I would leave them as they stand by all means. If not, I would blot\naccordingly.\n\nIt is only in the hope of being slightly useful to you by anticipating\nwhat I believe Mr. Phelps will discover--or what, if ever he should pass\nit, I have a strong conviction the audience will find out--that I have\nventured on these few hints. Your concurrence with them generally, on\nreconsideration, or your preference for the poem as it stands, can not\nin the least affect my interest in your success. On the other hand, I\nhave a perfect confidence in your not taking my misgivings ill; they\narise out of my sincere desire for the triumph of your work.\n\nWith renewed thanks for the pleasure you have afforded me,\n\n                                     I am, dear Sir, faithfully yours.",

Firstly, because they would detract from whatever fiery effect\nthe words may have in them; secondly, because writing and petitioning\nand pressing a subject upon members and candidates are now so clearly\nunderstood; and thirdly, because the paper was meant as an opening to a\npersistent pressure of the whole question on the public, which would\nyield other opportunities of touching on such points.\n\nIn the number _for next week_--not this--is one of those following-up\narticles called \"A Home Question.\" It is not written by me, but is\ngenerally of my suggesting, and is exceedingly well done by a thorough\nand experienced hand. I think you will find in it, generally, what you\nwant. I have told the printers to send you a proof by post as soon as it\nis corrected--that is to say, as soon as some insertions I made in it\nlast night are in type and in their places.\n\nMy dear old Parr, I don't believe a word you write about King John! That\nis to say, I don't believe you take into account the enormous difference\nbetween the energy summonable-up in your study at Sherborne and the\nenergy that will fire up in you (without so much as saying \"With your\nleave\" or \"By your leave\") in the Town Hall at Birmingham. I know you,\nyou ancient codger, I know you! Therefore I will trouble you to be so\ngood as to do an act of honesty after you have been to Birmingham, and\nto write to me, \"Ingenuous boy, you were correct. I find I could have\nread 'em 'King John' with the greatest ease.\"\n\nIn that vast hall in the busy town of Sherborne, in which our\nillustrious English novelist is expected to read next month--though he\nis strongly of opinion that he is deficient in power, and too old--I\nwonder what accommodation there is for reading! because our illustrious\ncountryman likes to stand at a desk breast-high, with plenty of room\nabout him, a sloping top, and a ledge to keep his book from tumbling\noff. If such a thing should not be there, however, on his arrival, I\nsuppose even a Sherborne carpenter could knock it up out of a deal\nboard. _Is_ there a deal board in Sherborne though? I should like to\nhear Katey's opinion on that point.\n\nIn this week's \"Household Words\" there is an exact portrait of our\nBoulogne landlord, which I hope you will like. I think of opening the\nnext long book I write with a man of juvenile figure and strong face,\nwho is always persuading himself that he is infirm. What do you think of\nthe idea? I should like to have your opinion about it. I would make him\nan impetuous passionate sort of fellow, devilish grim upon occasion, and\nof an iron purpose. Droll, I fancy?\n\n---- is getting a little too fat, but appears to be troubled by the\ngreat responsibility of directing the whole war. He doesn't seem to be\nquite clear that he has got the ships into the exact order he intended,\non the sea point of attack at Sebastopol. We went to the play last\nSaturday night with Stanfield, whose \"high lights\" (as Maclise calls\nthose knobs of brightness on the top of his cheeks) were more radiant\nthan ever. We talked of you, and I told Stanny how they are imitating\nhis \"Acis and Galatea\" sea in \"Pericles,\" at Phelps's. He didn't half\nlike it; but I added, in nautical language, that it was merely a\npiratical effort achieved by a handful of porpoise-faced swabs, and that\nbrought him up with a round turn, as we say at sea.\n\nWe are looking forward to the twentieth of next month with great\npleasure. All Tavistock House send love and kisses to all Sherborne\nHouse. If there is anything I can bring down for you, let me know in\ngood course of time.\n\n                             Ever, my dearest Macready,\n                                            Most affectionately yours.",

WATSON,\n\nI take upon myself to answer your letter to Catherine, as I am referred\nto in it.\n\nThe \"Walk\" is not my writing. It is very well done by a close imitator.\nWhy I found myself so \"used up\" after \"Hard Times\" I scarcely know,\nperhaps because I intended to do nothing in that way for a year, when\nthe idea laid hold of me by the throat in a very violent manner, and\nbecause the compression and close condensation necessary for that\ndisjointed form of publication gave me perpetual trouble. But I really\nwas tired, which is a result so very incomprehensible that I can't\nforget it. I have passed an idle autumn in a beautiful situation, and am\ndreadfully brown and big. For further particulars of Boulogne, see \"Our\nFrench Watering Place,\" in this present week of \"Household Words,\" which\ncontains a faithful portrait of our landlord there.\n\nIf you carry out that bright Croydon idea, rely on our glad\nco-operation, only let me know all about it a few days beforehand; and\nif you feel equal to the contemplation of the moustache (which has been\ncut lately) it will give us the heartiest pleasure to come and meet you.\nThis in spite of the terrific duffery of the Crystal Palace. It is a\nvery remarkable thing in itself; but to have so very large a building\ncontinually crammed down one's throat, and to find it a new page in \"The\nWhole Duty of Man\" to go there, is a little more than even I (and you\nknow how amiable I am) can endure.\n\nYou always like to know what I am going to do, so I beg to announce that\non the 19th of December I am going to read the \"Carol\" at Reading, where\nI undertook the presidency of the Literary Institution on the death of\npoor dear Talfourd. Then I am going on to Sherborne, in Dorsetshire, to\ndo the like for another institution, which is one of the few remaining\npleasures of Macready's life. Then I am coming home for Christmas Day.\nThen I believe I must go to Bradford, in Yorkshire, to read once more to\na little fireside party of four thousand. Then I am coming home again\nto get up a new little version of \"The Children in the Wood\" (yet to be\nwritten, by-the-bye), for the children to act on Charley's birthday.\n\nI am full of mixed feeling about the war--admiration of our valiant men,\nburning desires to cut the Emperor of Russia's throat, and something\nlike despair to see how the old cannon-smoke and blood-mists obscure the\nwrongs and sufferings of the people at home. When I consider the\nPatriotic Fund on the one hand, and on the other the poverty and\nwretchedness engendered by cholera, of which in London alone, an\ninfinitely larger number of English people than are likely to be slain\nin the whole Russian war have miserably and needlessly died--I feel as\nif the world had been pushed back five hundred years. If you are reading\nnew books just now, I think you will be interested with a controversy\nbetween Whewell and Brewster, on the question of the shining orbs about\nus being inhabited or no. Whewell's book is called, \"On the Plurality of\nWorlds;\" Brewster's, \"More Worlds than One.\" I shouldn't wonder if you\nknow all about them. They bring together a vast number of points of\ngreat interest in natural philosophy, and some very curious reasoning on\nboth sides, and leave the matter pretty much where it was.\n\nWe had a fine absurdity in connection with our luggage, when we left\nBoulogne. The barometer had within a few hours fallen about a foot, in\nhonour of the occasion, and it was a tremendous night, blowing a gale of\nwind and raining a little deluge. The luggage (pretty heavy, as you may\nsuppose), in a cart drawn by two horses, stuck fast in a rut in our\nfield, and couldn't be moved. Our man, made a lunatic by the extremity\nof the occasion, ran down to the town to get two more horses to help it\nout, when he returned with those horses and carter B, the most beaming\nof men; carter A, who had been soaking all the time by the disabled\nvehicle, descried in carter B the acknowledged enemy of his existence,\ntook his own two horses out, and walked off with them! After which, the\nwhole set-out remained in the field all night, and we came to town,\nthirteen individuals, with one comb and a pocket-handkerchief. I was\nupside-down during the greater part of the passage.\n\nDr. Rae's account of Franklin's unfortunate party is deeply interesting;\nbut I think hasty in its acceptance of the details, particularly in the\nstatement that they had eaten the dead bodies of their companions, which\nI don't believe. Franklin, on a former occasion, was almost starved to\ndeath, had gone through all the pains of that sad end, and lain down to\ndie, and no such thought had presented itself to any of them. In famous\ncases of shipwreck, it is very rare indeed that any person of any\nhumanising education or refinement resorts to this dreadful means of\nprolonging life. In open boats, the coarsest and commonest men of the\nshipwrecked party have done such things; but I don't remember more than\none instance in which an officer had overcome the loathing that the idea\nhad inspired. Dr. Rae talks about their _cooking_ these remains too. I\nshould like to know where the fuel came from.\n\n         Kindest love and best regards.\n                      Ever, my dear Mrs. Watson, affectionately yours.",

I did suppose that nothing in this\nsingular world could surprise me, but you have done it.\n\nYou will believe my congratulations on the delicacy and talent of your\nwriting to be sincere. From the first, I have always had an especial\ninterest in that Miss Berwick, and have over and over again questioned\nWills about her. I suppose he has gone on gradually building up an\nimaginary structure of life and adventure for her, but he has given me\nthe strangest information! Only yesterday week, when we were \"making up\"\n\"The Poor Travellers,\" as I sat meditatively poking the office fire, I\nsaid to him, \"Wills, have you got that Miss Berwick's proof back, of the\nlittle sailor's song?\" \"No,\" he said. \"Well, but why not?\" I asked him.\n\"Why, you know,\" he answered, \"as I have often told you before, she\ndon't live at the place to which her letters are addressed, and so\nthere's always difficulty and delay in communicating with her.\" \"Do you\nknow what age she is?\" I said. Here he looked unfathomably profound, and\nreturned, \"Rather advanced in life.\" \"You said she was a governess,\ndidn't you?\" said I; to which he replied in the most emphatic and\npositive manner, \"A governess.\"\n\nHe then came and stood in the corner of the hearth, with his back to the\nfire, and delivered himself like an oracle concerning you. He told me\nthat early in life (conveying to me the impression of about a quarter of\na century ago) you had had your feelings desperately wounded by some\ncause, real or imaginary--\"It does not matter which,\" said I, with the\ngreatest sagacity--and that you had then taken to writing verses. That\nyou were of an unhappy temperament, but keenly sensitive to\nencouragement. That you wrote after the educational duties of the day\nwere discharged. That you sometimes thought of never writing any more.\nThat you had been away for some time \"with your pupils.\" That your\nletters were of a mild and melancholy character, and that you did not\nseem to care as much as might be expected about money. All this time I\nsat poking the fire, with a wisdom upon me absolutely crushing; and\nfinally I begged him to assure the lady that she might trust me with her\nreal address, and that it would be better to have it now, as I hoped our\nfurther communications, etc. etc. etc. You must have felt enormously\nwicked last Tuesday, when I, such a babe in the wood, was unconsciously\nprattling to you. But you have given me so much pleasure, and have made\nme shed so many tears, that I can only think of you now in association\nwith the sentiment and grace of your verses.\n\nSo pray accept the blessing and forgiveness of Richard Watts, though I\nam afraid you come under both his conditions of exclusion.[20]\n\n                                                Very faithfully yours.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[16] The poet \"Barry Cornwall.\"\n\n[17] \"Hide and Seek.\"\n\n[18] On the occasion of the Prince Consort's visit to the camp at\nBoulogne.\n\n[19] Mr. Egg.\n\n[20] The inscription on the house in Rochester known as \"Watts's\nCharity\" is to the effect that it furnishes a night's lodging for six\npoor travellers--\"not being Rogues or Proctors.\"",

However, it was soon supplied by yourself, and the bowl became\nround and sound again.\n\nThe Christmas number of \"Household Words,\" I suppose, will reach\nLausanne about midsummer. The first ten pages or so--all under the head\nof \"The First Poor Traveller\"--are written by me, and I hope you will\nfind, in the story of the soldier which they contain, something that may\nmove you a little. It moved me _not_ a little in the writing, and I\nbelieve has touched a vast number of people. We have sold eighty\nthousand of it.\n\nI am but newly come home from reading at Reading (where I succeeded poor\nTalfourd as the president of an institution), and at Sherborne, in\nDorsetshire, and at Bradford, in Yorkshire. Wonderful audiences! and the\nnumber at the last place three thousand seven hundred. And yet but for\nthe noise of their laughing and cheering, they \"went\" like one man.\n\nThe absorption of the English mind in the war is, to me, a melancholy\nthing. Every other subject of popular solicitude and sympathy goes down\nbefore it. I fear I clearly see that for years to come domestic reforms\nare shaken to the root; every miserable red-tapist flourishes war over\nthe head of every protester against his humbug; and everything connected\nwith it is pushed to such an unreasonable extent, that, however kind and\nnecessary it may be in itself, it becomes ridiculous. For all this it is\nan indubitable fact, I conceive, that Russia MUST BE stopped, and that\nthe future peace of the world renders the war imperative upon us. The\nDuke of Newcastle lately addressed a private letter to the newspapers,\nentreating them to exercise a larger discretion in respect of the\nletters of \"Our Own Correspondents,\" against which Lord Raglan protests\nas giving the Emperor of Russia information for nothing which would cost\nhim (if indeed he could get it at all) fifty or a hundred thousand\npounds a year. The communication has not been attended with much effect,\nso far as I can see. In the meantime I do suppose we have the\nwretchedest Ministry that ever was--in whom nobody not in office of some\nsort believes--yet whom there is nobody to displace. The strangest\nresult, perhaps, of years of Reformed Parliaments that ever the general\nsagacity did _not_ foresee.\n\nLet me recommend you, as a brother-reader of high distinction, two\ncomedies, both Goldsmith's--\"She Stoops to Conquer\" and \"The\nGood-natured Man.\" Both are so admirable and so delightfully written\nthat they read wonderfully. A friend of mine, Forster, who wrote \"The\nLife of Goldsmith,\" was very ill a year or so ago, and begged me to read\nto him one night as he lay in bed, \"something of Goldsmith's.\" I fell\nupon \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" and we enjoyed it with that wonderful\nintensity, that I believe he began to get better in the first scene, and\nwas all right again in the fifth act.\n\nI am charmed by your account of Haldimand, to whom my love. Tell him\nSydney Smith's daughter has privately printed a life of her father with\nselections from his letters, which has great merit, and often presents\nhim exactly as he used to be. I have strongly urged her to publish it,\nand I think she will do so, about March.\n\nMy eldest boy has come home from Germany to learn a business life at\nBirmingham (I think), first of all. The whole nine are well and happy.\nDitto, Mrs. Dickens. Ditto, Georgina. My two girls are full of interest\nin yours; and one of mine (as I think I told you when I was at Elysee)\nis curiously like one of yours in the face. They are all agog now about\na great fairy play, which is to come off here next Monday.

This is my object. If I could possibly bring it to bear, it\nwould make a very attractive reading, with, a strong interest in it, and\na certain completeness.\n\nThis is exactly the state of the case. I don't mind confiding to you,\nthat I never can approach the book with perfect composure (it had such\nperfect possession of me when I wrote it), and that I no sooner begin to\ntry to get it into this form, than I begin to read it all, and to feel\nthat I cannot disturb it.

I do not care whether it\nis an hotel or not, but the reason why I do not write for an apartment\nto the Hotel Brighton is, that there they expect one to dine at home (I\nmean in the apartment) generally; whereas, as we are coming to Paris\nexpressly to be always looking about us, we want to dine wherever we\nlike every day. Consequently, what we want to find is a good apartment,\nwhere we can have our breakfast but where we shall never dine.\n\nCan you engage such accommodation for me?

Will you tell Catherine with my\nlove, that I will write to her again to-morrow afternoon; I hope she may\nthen receive my letter by Monday morning, and in it I purpose telling\nher when I may be expected home.

We have made up our minds to abandon it for the present, and\nto return about Tuesday night or Wednesday. Collins continues in a queer\nstate, but is perfectly cheerful under the stoppage of his wine and\nother afflictions.\n\nWe have a beautiful apartment, very elegantly furnished, very thickly\ncarpeted, and as warm as any apartment in Paris _can_ be in such\nweather. We are very well waited on and looked after. We breakfast at\nten, read and write till two, and then I go out walking all over Paris,\nwhile the invalid sits by the fire or is deposited in a cafe. We dine at\nfive, in a different restaurant every day, and at seven or so go to the\ntheatre--sometimes to two theatres, sometimes to three. We get home\nabout twelve, light the fire, and drink lemonade, to which _I_ add rum.\nWe go to bed between one and two. I live in peace, like an elderly\ngentleman, and regard myself as in a negative state of virtue and\nrespectability.\n\nThe theatres are not particularly good, but I have seen Lemaitre act in\nthe most wonderful and astounding manner. I am afraid we must go to the\nOpera Comique on Sunday. To-morrow we dine with Regnier and to-day with\nthe Olliffes.\n\n\"La Joie fait Peur,\" at the Francais, delighted me. Exquisitely played\nand beautifully imagined altogether. Last night we went to the Porte St.\nMartin to see a piece (English subject) called \"Jane Osborne,\" which the\ncharacters pronounce \"Ja Nosbornnne.\" The seducer was Lord Nottingham.\nThe comic Englishwoman's name (she kept lodgings and was a very bad\ncharacter) was Missees Christmas. She had begun to get into great\ndifficulties with a gentleman of the name of Meestair Cornhill, when we\nwere obliged to leave, at the end of the first act, by the intolerable\nstench of the place. The whole theatre must be standing over some vast\ncesspool. It was so alarming that I instantly rushed into a cafe and had\nbrandy.\n\nMy ear has gradually become so accustomed to French, that I understand\nthe people at the theatres (for the first time) with perfect ease and\nsatisfaction. I walked about with Regnier for an hour and a half\nyesterday, and received many compliments on my angelic manner of\nspeaking the celestial language. There is a winter Franconi's now, high\nup on the Boulevards, just like the round theatre on the Champs Elysees,\nand as bright and beautiful. A clown from Astley's is all in high favour\nthere at present. He talks slang English (being evidently an idiot), as\nif he felt a perfect confidence that everybody understands him. His\nname is Boswell, and the whole cirque rang last night with cries for Boz\nZwilllll! Boz Zweellll! Boz Zwuallll! etc. etc. etc. etc.\n\nI must begin to look out for the box of bon-bons for the noble and\nfascinating Plornish-Maroon.

I\nhave also communicated with Jerrold, whom I trust, and have begged him\nnot to be diverted from the straight path of help to the most useful man\nin England on all possible occasions.

It will be a most acceptable occupation\nto me to go over them with you, and I have not a doubt of their\nproducing a strong effect out of doors.\n\nThere is nothing in the present time at once so galling and so alarming\nto me as the alienation of the people from their own public affairs. I\nhave no difficulty in understanding it. They have had so little to do\nwith the game through all these years of Parliamentary Reform, that they\nhave sullenly laid down their cards, and taken to looking on. The\nplayers who are left at the table do not see beyond it, conceive that\ngain and loss and all the interest of the play are in their hands, and\nwill never be wiser until they and the table and the lights and the\nmoney are all overturned together. And I believe the discontent to be so\nmuch the worse for smouldering, instead of blazing openly, that it is\nextremely like the general mind of France before the breaking out of the\nfirst Revolution, and is in danger of being turned by any one of a\nthousand accidents--a bad harvest--the last strain too much of\naristocratic insolence or incapacity--a defeat abroad--a mere chance at\nhome--with such a devil of a conflagration as never has been beheld\nsince.\n\nMeanwhile, all our English tuft-hunting, toad-eating, and other\nmanifestations of accursed gentility--to say nothing of the Lord knows\nwho's defiances of the proven truth before six hundred and fifty\nmen--ARE expressing themselves every day. So, every day, the disgusted\nmillions with this unnatural gloom are confirmed and hardened in the\nvery worst of moods. Finally, round all this is an atmosphere of\npoverty, hunger, and ignorant desperation, of the mere existence of\nwhich perhaps not one man in a thousand of those not actually enveloped\nin it, through the whole extent of this country, has the least idea.\n\nIt seems to me an absolute impossibility to direct the spirit of the\npeople at this pass until it shows itself. If they begin to bestir\nthemselves in the vigorous national manner; if they would appear in\npolitical reunion, array themselves peacefully but in vast numbers\nagainst a system that they know to be rotten altogether, make themselves\nheard like the sea all round this island, I for one should be in such a\nmovement heart and soul, and should think it a duty of the plainest kind\nto go along with it, and try to guide it by all possible means. But you\ncan no more help a people who do not help themselves than you can help\na man who does not help himself.

Will you come out of\nschool to this breezy vacation on the same day, or rather _this day\nfortnight, July 31st_? for that is the day on which he leaves us, and we\nbegin (here's a parent!) to be able to be comfortable.

It rained, in honour of our arrival, with the\ngreatest vigour, yesterday. I went out after dinner to buy some nails\n(you know the arrangements that would be then in progress), and I\nstopped in the rain, about halfway down a steep, crooked street, like a\ncrippled ladder, to look at a little coachmaker's, where there had just\nbeen a sale. Speculating on the insolvent coachmaker's business, and\nwhat kind of coaches he could possibly have expected to get orders for\nin Folkestone, I thought, \"What would bring together fifty people now,\nin this little street, at this little rainy minute?\" On the instant, a\nbrewer's van, with two mad horses in it, and the harness dangling about\nthem--like the trappings of those horses you are acquainted with, who\nbolted through the starry courts of heaven--dashed by me, and in that\ninstant, such a crowd as would have accumulated in Fleet Street sprang\nup magically. Men fell out of windows, dived out of doors, plunged down\ncourts, precipitated themselves down steps, came down waterspouts,\ninstead of rain, I think, and I never saw so wonderful an instance of\nthe gregarious effect of an excitement.\n\nA man, a woman, and a child had been thrown out on the horses taking\nfright and the reins breaking. The child is dead, and the woman very ill\nbut will probably recover, and the man has a hand broken and other\nmischief done to him.\n\nLet me know what Wigan says. If he does not take the play, and readily\ntoo, I would recommend you not to offer it elsewhere.

If a hornpipe will be acceptable to\nyou at any time (as a reminder of what the three brothers were always\ndoing), I shall be, as the chairman says at Mr. Evans's, \"happy to\noblige.\"\n\nI have almost finished No. 3, in which I have relieved my indignant soul\nwith a scarifier.

My fair Laura has not yet reported\nconcerning Paris, but I should think will have done so before I see you.\nAnd now to that point. I purpose being in town on _Monday, the 8th_,\nwhen I have promised to dine with Forster. At the office, between\nhalf-past eleven and one that day, I will expect you, unless I hear\nfrom you to the contrary. Of course the H. W. stories are at your\ndisposition. If you should have completed your idea, we might breakfast\ntogether at the G. on the Tuesday morning and discuss it. Or I shall be\nin town after ten on the Monday night. At the office I will tell you the\nidea of the Christmas number, which will put you in train, I hope, for a\nstory. I have postponed the shipwreck idea for a year, as it seemed to\nrequire more force from me than I could well give it with the weight of\na new start upon me.\n\nAll here send their kindest remembrances.

All the fishermen in the place, all the nondescripts, and all\nthe boys pulled at it with ropes from six A.M. to four P.M. Every now\nand then the ropes broke, and they all fell down in the shingle. The\nobstinate way in which the beastly thing wouldn't move was so\nexasperating that I wondered they didn't shoot it, or burn it. Whenever\nit moved an inch they all cheered; whenever it wouldn't move they all\nswore. Finally, when it was quite given over, some one tumbled against\nit accidentally (as it appeared to me, looking out at my window here),\nand it instantly shot about a mile into the sea, and they all stood\nlooking at it helplessly.\n\nKind regards to Pigott, in which all unite.\n\n                                                      Ever faithfully.",

How\ndelightful it would be to see your aged countenance and perfectly bald\nhead in that capital! It will renew your youth, to visit a theatre\n(previously dining at the Trois Freres) in company with the jocund boy\nwho now addresses you. Do, do stick to it.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear, I know, that Charley has gone into Baring's\nhouse under very auspicious circumstances. Mr. Bates, of that firm, had\ndone me the kindness to place him at the brokers' where he was. And when\nsaid Bates wrote to me a fortnight ago to say that an excellent opening\nhad presented itself at Baring's, he added that the brokers gave Charley\n\"so high a character for ability and zeal\" that it would be unfair to\nreceive him as a volunteer, and he must begin at a fifty-pound salary,\nto which I graciously consented.\n\nAs to the suffrage, I have lost hope even in the ballot. We appear to me\nto have proved the failure of representative institutions without an\neducated and advanced people to support them. What with teaching people\nto \"keep in their stations,\" what with bringing up the soul and body of\nthe land to be a good child, or to go to the beershop, to go a-poaching\nand go to the devil; what with having no such thing as a middle class\n(for though we are perpetually bragging of it as our safety, it is\nnothing but a poor fringe on the mantle of the upper); what with\nflunkyism, toadyism, letting the most contemptible lords come in for all\nmanner of places, reading _The Court Circular_ for the New Testament, I\ndo reluctantly believe that the English people are habitually consenting\nparties to the miserable imbecility into which we have fallen, _and\nnever will help themselves out of it_. Who is to do it, if anybody is,\nGod knows. But at present we are on the down-hill road to being\nconquered, and the people WILL be content to bear it, sing \"Rule\nBritannia,\" and WILL NOT be saved.\n\nIn No. 3 of my new book I have been blowing off a little of indignant\nsteam which would otherwise blow me up, and with God's leave I shall\nwalk in the same all the days of my life; but I have no present\npolitical faith or hope--not a grain.\n\nI am going to read the \"Carol\" here to-morrow in a long carpenter's\nshop, which looks far more alarming as a place to hear in than the Town\nHall at Birmingham.\n\nKindest loves from all to your dear sister, Kate and the darlings.

However, we have found two apartments--an _entresol_ and\na first floor, with a kitchen and servants' room at the top of the\nhouse, at No. 49, Avenue des Champs Elysees.\n\nYou must be prepared for a regular Continental abode. There is only one\nwindow in each room, but the front apartments all look upon the main\nstreet of the Champs Elysees, and the view is delightfully cheerful.\nThere are also plenty of rooms. They are not over and above well\nfurnished, but by changing furniture from rooms we don't care for to\nrooms we _do_ care for, we shall be able to make them home-like and\npresentable. I think the situation itself almost the finest in Paris;\nand the children will have a window from which to look on the busy life\noutside.\n\nWe could have got a beautiful apartment in the Rue Faubourg St. Honore\nfor a very little more, most elegantly furnished; but the greater part\nof it was on a courtyard, and it would never have done for the children.\nThis, that I have taken for six months, is seven hundred francs per\nmonth, and twenty more for the _concierge_. What you have to expect is a\nregular French residence, which a little habitation will make pretty and\ncomfortable, with nothing showy in it, but with plenty of rooms, and\nwith that wonderful street in which the Barriere de l'Etoile stands\noutside. The amount of rooms is the great thing, and I believe it to be\nthe place best suited for us, at a not unreasonable price in Paris.\n\nGeorgina and Lady Olliffe[22] send their loves.

I send this reply by my brother Alfred, who is here, and\nwho returns home to-morrow. You should get it at the office early on\nTuesday.\n\nI will go to work to-morrow, and will send you, please God, an article\nby Tuesday's post, which you will get on Wednesday forenoon. Look\ncarefully to the proof, as I shall not have time to receive it for\ncorrection. When you arrange about sending your parcels, will you\nascertain, and communicate to me, the prices of telegraph messages? It\nwill save me trouble, having no foreign servant (though French is in\nthat respect a trump), and may be useful on an emergency.\n\nI have two floors here--_entresol_ and first--in a doll's house, but\nreally pretty within, and the view without astounding, as you will say\nwhen you come. The house is on the Exposition side, about half a quarter\nof a mile above Franconi's, of course on the other side of the way, and\nclose to the Jardin d'Hiver. Each room has but one window in it, but we\nhave no fewer than six rooms (besides the back ones) looking on the\nChamps Elysees, with the wonderful life perpetually flowing up and down.\nWe have no spare-room, but excellent stowage for the whole family,\nincluding a capital dressing-room for me, and a really slap-up kitchen\nnear the stairs. Damage for the whole, seven hundred francs a month.\n\nBut, sir--but--when Georgina, the servants, and I were here for the\nfirst night (Catherine and the rest being at Boulogne), I heard Georgy\nrestless--turned out--asked: \"What's the matter?\" \"Oh, it's dreadfully\ndirty. I can't sleep for the smell of my room.\" Imagine all my\nstage-managerial energies multiplied at daybreak by a thousand. Imagine\nthe porter, the porter's wife, the porter's wife's sister, a feeble\nupholsterer of enormous age from round the corner, and all his workmen\n(four boys), summoned. Imagine the partners in the proprietorship of the\napartment, and martial little man with Francois-Prussian beard, also\nsummoned. Imagine your inimitable chief briefly explaining that dirt is\nnot in his way, and that he is driven to madness, and that he devotes\nhimself to no coat and a dirty face, until the apartment is thoroughly\npurified. Imagine co-proprietors at first astounded, then urging that\n\"it's not the custom,\" then wavering, then affected, then confiding\ntheir utmost private sorrows to the Inimitable, offering new carpets\n(accepted), embraces (not accepted), and really responding like French\nbricks. Sallow, unbrushed, unshorn, awful, stalks the Inimitable through\nthe apartment until last night. Then all the improvements were\nconcluded, and I do really believe the place to be now worth eight or\nnine hundred francs per month. You must picture it as the smallest place\nyou ever saw, but as exquisitely cheerful and vivacious, clean as\nanything human can be, and with a moving panorama always outside, which\nis Paris in itself.\n\nYou mention a letter from Miss Coutts as to Mrs. Brown's illness, which\nyou say is \"enclosed to Mrs. Charles Dickens.\"\n\nIt is not enclosed, and I am mad to know where she writes from that I\nmay write to her. Pray set this right, for her uneasiness will be\ngreatly intensified if she have no word from me.\n\nI thought we were to give L1,700 for the house at Gad's Hill. Are we\nbound to L1,800? Considering the improvements to be made, it is a little\ntoo much, isn't it? I have a strong impression that at the utmost we\nwere only to divide the difference, and not to pass L1,750.

They won't let a\npurchaser escape for the sake of the L100, I think. And Austin was\nstrongly of opinion, when I saw him last, that L1,700 was enough.\n\nYou cannot think how pleasant it is to me to find myself generally known\nand liked here. If I go into a shop to buy anything, and give my card,\nthe officiating priest or priestess brightens up, and says: \"_Ah! c'est\nl'ecrivain celebre! Monsieur porte un nom tres-distingue. Mais! je suis\nhonore et interesse de voir Monsieur Dick-in. Je lis un des livres de\nmonsieur tous les jours_\" (in the _Moniteur_).

The scene is the railway terminus at\nParis, with the electric telegraph office on the prompt side, and the\nclerks _with their backs to the audience_--much more real than if they\nwere, as they infallibly would be, staring about the house--working the\nneedles; and the little bell perpetually ringing. There are assembled to\ngreet the soldiers, all the easily and naturally imagined elements of\ninterest--old veteran fathers, young children, agonised mothers, sisters\nand brothers, girl lovers--each impatient to know of his or her own\nobject of solicitude. Enter to these a certain marquis, full of sympathy\nfor all, who says: \"My friends, I am one of you. My brother has no\ncommission yet. He is a common soldier. I wait for him as well as all\nbrothers and sisters here wait for _their_ brothers. Tell me whom you\nare expecting.\" Then they all tell him. Then he goes into the\ntelegraph-office, and sends a message down the line to know how long the\ntroops will be. Bell rings. Answer handed out on slip of paper. \"Delay\non the line. Troops will not arrive for a quarter of an hour.\" General\ndisappointment. \"But we have this brave electric telegraph, my friends,\"\nsays the marquis. \"Give me your little messages, and I'll send them\noff.\" General rush round the marquis. Exclamations: \"How's Henri?\" \"My\nlove to Georges;\" \"Has Guillaume forgotten Elise?\" \"Is my son wounded?\"\n\"Is my brother promoted?\" etc. etc. Marquis composes tumult. Sends\nmessage--such a regiment, such a company--\"Elise's love to Georges.\"\nLittle bell rings, slip of paper handed out--\"Georges in ten minutes\nwill embrace his Elise. Sends her a thousand kisses.\" Marquis sends\nmessage--such a regiment, such a company--\"Is my son wounded?\" Little\nbell rings. Slip of paper handed out--\"No. He has not yet upon him those\nmarks of bravery in the glorious service of his country which his dear\nold father bears\" (father being lamed and invalided). Last of all, the\nwidowed mother. Marquis sends message--such a regiment, such a\ncompany--\"Is my only son safe?\" Little bell rings. Slip of paper handed\nout--\"He was first upon the heights of Alma.\" General cheer. Bell rings\nagain, another slip of paper handed out. \"He was made a sergeant at\nInkermann.\" Another cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper\nhanded out. \"He was made colour-sergeant at Sebastopol.\" Another cheer.\nBell rings again, another slip of paper handed out. \"He was the first\nman who leaped with the French banner on the Malakhoff tower.\"\nTremendous cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper handed out.\n\"But he was struck down there by a musket-ball, and----Troops have\nproceeded. Will arrive in half a minute after this.\" Mother abandons all\nhope; general commiseration; troops rush in, down a platform; son only\nwounded, and embraces her.\n\nAs I have said, and as you will see, this is available for any purpose.\nBut done with equal distinction and rapidity, it is a tremendous effect,\nand got by the simplest means in the world. There is nothing in the\npiece, but it was impossible not to be moved and excited by the\ntelegraph part of it.\n\nI hope you have seen something of Stanny, and have been to pantomimes\nwith him, and have drunk to the absent Dick. I miss you, my dear old\nboy, at the play, woefully, and miss the walk home, and the partings at\nthe corner of Tavistock Square. And when I go by myself, I come home\nstewing \"Little Dorrit\" in my head; and the best part of _my_ play is\n(or ought to be) in Gordon Street.\n\nI have written to Beaucourt about taking that breezy house--a little\nimproved--for the summer, and I hope you and yours will come there often\nand stay there long. My present idea, if nothing should arise to unroot\nme sooner, is to stay here until the middle of May, then plant the\nfamily at Boulogne, and come with Catherine and Georgy home for two or\nthree weeks. When I shall next run across I don't know, but I suppose\nnext month.\n\nWe are up to our knees in mud here. Literally in vehement despair, I\nwalked down the avenue outside the Barriere de l'Etoile here yesterday,\nand went straight on among the trees. I came back with top-boots of mud\non. Nothing will cleanse the streets. Numbers of men and women are for\never scooping and sweeping in them, and they are always one lake of\nyellow mud. All my trousers go to the tailor's every day, and are\nravelled out at the heels every night. Washing is awful.\n\nTell Mrs. Lemon, with my love, that I have bought her some Eau d'Or, in\ngrateful remembrance of her knowing what it is, and crushing the tyrant\nof her existence by resolutely refusing to be put down when that monster\nwould have silenced her. You may imagine the loves and messages that are\nnow being poured in upon me by all of them, so I will give none of them;\nthough I am pretending to be very scrupulous about it, and am looking (I\nhave no doubt) as if I were writing them down with the greatest care.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

Wilkie Collins.]\n\n                      49, CHAMPS ELYSEES, _Saturday, Jan. 19th, 1856._\n\nMY DEAR COLLINS,\n\nI had no idea you were so far on with your book, and heartily\ncongratulate you on being within sight of land.\n\nIt is excessively pleasant to me to get your letter, as it opens a\nperspective of theatrical and other lounging evenings, and also of\narticles in \"Household Words.\" It will not be the first time that we\nshall have got on well in Paris, and I hope it will not be by many a\ntime the last.\n\nI purpose coming over, early in February (as soon, in fact, as I shall\nhave knocked out No. 5 of \"Little D.\"), and therefore we can return in a\njovial manner together. As soon as I know my day of coming over, I will\nwrite to you again, and (as the merchants--say Charley--would add)\n\"communicate same\" to you.\n\nThe lodging, _en garcon_, shall be duly looked up, and I shall of course\nmake a point of finding it close here. There will be no difficulty in\nthat. I will have concluded the treaty before starting for London, and\nwill take it by the month, both because that is the cheapest way, and\nbecause desirable places don't let for shorter terms.\n\nI have been sitting to Scheffer to-day--conceive this, if you please,\nwith No. 5 upon my soul--four hours!! I am so addleheaded and bored,\nthat if you were here, I should propose an instantaneous rush to the\nTrois Freres. Under existing circumstances I have no consolation.\n\nI think THE portrait[23] is the most astounding thing ever beheld upon\nthis globe. It has been shrieked over by the united family as \"Oh! the\nvery image!\" I went down to the _entresol_ the moment I opened it, and\nsubmitted it to the Plorn--then engaged, with a half-franc musket, in\ncapturing a Malakhoff of chairs. He looked at it very hard, and gave it\nas his opinion that it was Misser Hegg. We suppose him to have\nconfounded the Colonel with Jollins. I met Madame Georges Sand the other\nday at a dinner got up by Madame Viardot for that great purpose. The\nhuman mind cannot conceive any one more astonishingly opposed to all my\npreconceptions. If I had been shown her in a state of repose, and asked\nwhat I thought her to be, I should have said: \"The Queen's monthly\nnurse.\" _Au reste_, she has nothing of the _bas bleu_ about her, and is\nvery quiet and agreeable.\n\nThe way in which mysterious Frenchmen call and want to embrace me,\nsuggests to any one who knows me intimately, such infamous lurking,\nslinking, getting behind doors, evading, lying--so much mean resort to\ncraven flights, dastard subterfuges, and miserable poltroonery--on my\npart, that I merely suggest the arrival of cards like this:\n\n[Illustration: HW:\n\n  Horgues\n  homme de lettres\n  or\n  Drouse\n  membre de l'Institut\n  or\n  Cregibus Patalanternois\n  Ecole des Beaux arts\n\n  --every five minutes. Books also arrive with, on the flyleaf,\n\n  Jaubaud\n  Hommage a l'illustre romancier d'Angleterre\n\n  Charles De Kean.]\n\n--and I then write letters of terrific _empressement_, with assurances\nof all sorts of profound considerations, and never by any chance become\nvisible to the naked eye.\n\nAt the Porte St. Martin they are doing the \"Orestes,\" put into French\nverse by Alexandre Dumas. Really one of the absurdest things I ever saw.\nThe scene of the tomb, with all manner of classical females, in black,\ngrouping themselves on the lid, and on the steps, and on each other, and\nin every conceivable aspect of obtrusive impossibility, is just like the\nwindow of one of those artists in hair, who address the friends of\ndeceased persons. To-morrow week a fete is coming off at the Jardin\nd'Hiver, next door but one here, which I must certainly go to. The fete\nof the company of the Folies Nouvelles! The ladies of the company are to\nkeep stalls, and are to sell to Messieurs the Amateurs orange-water and\nlemonade. Paul le Grand is to promenade among the company, dressed as\nPierrot. Kalm, the big-faced comic singer, is to do the like, dressed as\na Russian Cossack. The entertainments are to conclude with \"La Polka des\nBetes feroces, par la Troupe entiere des Folies Nouvelles.\" I wish,\nwithout invasion of the rights of British subjects, or risk of war, ----\ncould be seized by French troops, brought over, and made to assist.\n\nThe _appartement_ has not grown any bigger since you last had the joy of\nbeholding me, and upon my honour and word I live in terror of asking\n---- to dinner, lest she should not be able to get in at the dining-room\ndoor. I _think_ (am not sure) the dining-room would hold her, if she\ncould be once passed in, but I don't see my way to that. Nevertheless,\nwe manage our own family dinners very snugly there, and have good ones,\nas I think you will say, every day at half-past five.\n\nI have a notion that we may knock out a _series_ of descriptions for H.\nW. without much trouble. It is very difficult to get into the\nCatacombs, but my name is so well known here that I think I may succeed.\nI find that the guillotine can be got set up in private, like Punch's\nshow. What do you think of _that_ for an article? I find myself\nunderlining words constantly. It is not my nature. It is mere imbecility\nafter the four hours' sitting.\n\nAll unite in kindest remembrances to you, your mother and brother.\n\n                                                       Ever cordially.",

Business correspondence with all sorts and\nconditions of men and women, O my Mary! is one of the dragons I am\nperpetually fighting; and the more I throw it, the more it stands upon\nits hind legs, rampant, and throws me.\n\nYes, on that bright cold morning when I left Peterboro', I felt that the\nbest thing I could do was to say that word that I would do anything in\nan honest way to avoid saying, at one blow, and make off. I was so sorry\nto leave you all! You can scarcely imagine what a chill and blank I felt\non that Monday evening at Rockingham. It was so sad to me, and\nengendered a constraint so melancholy and peculiar, that I doubt if I\nwere ever much more out of sorts in my life. Next morning, when it was\nlight and sparkling out of doors, I felt more at home again. But when I\ncame in from seeing poor dear Watson's grave, Mrs. Watson asked me to go\nup in the gallery, which I had last seen in the days of our merry play.\nWe went up, and walked into the very part he had made and was so fond\nof, and she looked out of one window and I looked out of another, and\nfor the life of me I could not decide in my own heart whether I should\nconsole or distress her by going and taking her hand, and saying\nsomething of what was naturally in my mind. So I said nothing, and we\ncame out again, and on the whole perhaps it was best; for I have no\ndoubt we understood each other very well without speaking a word.\n\nSheffield was a tremendous success and an admirable audience. They made\nme a present of table-cutlery after the reading was over; and I came\naway by the mail-train within three-quarters of an hour, changing my\ndress and getting on my wrappers partly in the fly, partly at the inn,\npartly on the platform. When we got among the Lincolnshire fens it began\nto snow. That changed to sleet, that changed to rain; the frost was all\ngone as we neared London, and the mud has all come. At two or three\no'clock in the morning I stopped at Peterboro' again, and thought of you\nall disconsolately. The lady in the refreshment-room was very hard upon\nme, harder even than those fair enslavers usually are. She gave me a cup\nof tea, as if I were a hyena and she my cruel keeper with a strong\ndislike to me. I mingled my tears with it, and had a petrified bun of\nenormous antiquity in miserable meekness.\n\nIt is clear to me that climates are gradually assimilating over a great\npart of the world, and that in the most miserable part of our year there\nis very little to choose between London and Paris, except that London is\nnot so muddy. I have never seen dirtier or worse weather than we have\nhad here since I returned. In desperation I went out to the Barrieres\nlast Sunday on a headlong walk, and came back with my very eyebrows\nsmeared with mud. Georgina is usually invisible during the walking time\nof the day. A turned-up nose may be seen in the midst of splashes, but\nnothing more.\n\nI am settling to work again, and my horrible restlessness immediately\nassails me. It belongs to such times. As I was writing the preceding\npage, it suddenly came into my head that I would get up and go to\nCalais. I don't know why; the moment I got there I should want to go\nsomewhere else. But, as my friend the Boots says (see Christmas number\n\"Household Words\"): \"When you come to think what a game you've been up\nto ever since you was in your own cradle, and what a poor sort of a chap\nyou were, and how it's always yesterday with you, or else to-morrow, and\nnever to-day, that's where it is.\"\n\nMy dear Mary, would you favour me with the name and address of the\nprofessor that taught you writing, for I want to improve myself? Many a\nhand have I seen with many characteristics of beauty in it--some loopy,\nsome dashy, some large, some small, some sloping to the right, some\nsloping to the left, some not sloping at all; but what I like in _your_\nhand, Mary, is its plainness, it is like print. Them as runs may read\njust as well as if they stood still. I should have thought it was\ncopper-plate if I hadn't known you. They send all sorts of messages from\nhere, and so do I, with my best regards to Bedgy and pardner and the\nblessed babbies. When shall we meet again, I wonder, and go somewhere!\nAh!\n\n                     Believe me ever, my dear Mary,\n                                    Yours truly and affectionately,\n\n                                                                  Joe.\n                          (That doesn't look plain.)\n                                                                  JOE.",

Charley was in great force, and floored\nPeter Cunningham and the Audit Office on a question about some bill\ntransactions with Baring's. The other guests were B. and E., Shirley\nBrooks, Forster, and that's all. The dinner admirable. I never had a\nbetter. All the wine I sent down from Tavistock House. Anne waited, and\nlooked well and happy, very much brighter altogether. It gave me great\npleasure to see her so improved. Just before dinner I got all the\nletters from home. They could not have arrived more opportunely.\n\nThe godfather's present looks charming now it is engraved, and John is\njust now going off to take it to Mrs. Yates.

But in case that day should be too late for the\nbeginning of your brief visit with a deference to any other engagements\nyou have in contemplation, then fix an earlier one, and I will make\n\"Little Dorrit\" curtsy to it. My recent visit to London and my having\nonly just now come back have thrown me a little behindhand; but I hope\nto come up with a wet sail in a few days.\n\nYou should have seen the ruins of Covent Garden Theatre. I went in the\nmoment I got to London--four days after the fire. Although the audience\npart and the stage were so tremendously burnt out that there was not a\npiece of wood half the size of a lucifer-match for the eye to rest on,\nthough nothing whatever remained but bricks and smelted iron lying on a\ngreat black desert, the theatre still looked so wonderfully like its\nold self grown gigantic that I never saw so strange a sight. The wall\ndividing the front from the stage still remained, and the iron\npass-doors stood ajar in an impossible and inaccessible frame. The\narches that supported the stage were there, and the arches that\nsupported the pit; and in the centre of the latter lay something like a\nTitanic grape-vine that a hurricane had pulled up by the roots, twisted,\nand flung down there; this was the great chandelier. Gye had kept the\nmen's wardrobe at the top of the house over the great entrance\nstaircase; when the roof fell in it came down bodily, and all that part\nof the ruins was like an old Babylonic pavement, bright rays tesselating\nthe black ground, sometimes in pieces so large that I could make out the\nclothes in the \"Trovatore.\"\n\nI should run on for a couple of hours if I had to describe the spectacle\nas I saw it, wherefore I will immediately muzzle myself. All here unite\nin kindest loves to dear Miss Macready, to Katie, Lillie, Benvenuta, my\ngodson, and the noble Johnny. We are charmed to hear such happy accounts\nof Willy and Ned, and send our loving remembrance to them in the next\nletters. All Parisian novelties you shall see and hear for yourself.\n\n                         Ever, my dearest Macready,\n                                             Your affectionate Friend.\n\nP.S.--Mr. F.'s aunt sends her defiant respects.",

On that expected Sunday you will lunch at Amiens but not\ndine, because we shall wait dinner for you, and you will merely have to\ntell that driver in the glazed hat to come straight here. When the\nWhites left I added their little apartment to this little apartment,\nconsequently you shall have a snug bedroom (is it not waiting expressly\nfor you?) overlooking the Champs Elysees. As to the arm-chair in my\nheart, no man on earth----but, good God! you know all about it.\n\nYou will find us in the queerest of little rooms all alone, except that\nthe son of Collins the painter (who writes a good deal in \"Household\nWords\") dines with us every day. Scheffer and Scribe shall be admitted\nfor one evening, because they know how to appreciate you. The Emperor we\nwill not ask unless you expressly wish it; it makes a fuss.\n\nIf you have no appointed hotel at Boulogne, go to the Hotel des Bains,\nthere demand \"Marguerite,\" and tell her that I commended you to her\nspecial care. It is the best house within my experience in France;\nMarguerite the best housekeeper in the world.\n\nI shall charge at \"Little Dorrit\" to-morrow with new spirits.

But I took twenty-mile walks in the\nfresh air, and perhaps in the long run did better than if I had been at\nwork. The report concerning Scheffer's portrait I had from Ward. It is\nin the best place in the largest room, but I find the _general_\nimpression of the artists exactly mine. They almost all say that it\nwants something; that nobody could mistake whom it was meant for, but\nthat it has something disappointing in it, etc. etc. Stanfield likes it\nbetter than any of the other painters, I think. His own picture is\nmagnificent. And Frith, in a \"Little Child's Birthday Party,\" is quite\ndelightful. There are many interesting pictures. When you see Scheffer,\ntell him from me that Eastlake, in his speech at the dinner, referred to\nthe portrait as \"a contribution from a distinguished man of genius in\nFrance, worthy of himself and of his subject.\"\n\nI did the maddest thing last night, and am deeply penitent this morning.\nWe stayed at Webster's till any hour, and they wanted me, at last, to\nmake punch, which couldn't be done when the jug was brought, because (to\nWebster's burning indignation) there was only one lemon in the house.\nHereupon I then and there besought the establishment in general to come\nand drink punch on Thursday night, after the play; on which occasion it\nwill become necessary to furnish fully the table with some cold viands\nfrom Fortnum and Mason's. Mark has looked in since I began this note, to\nsuggest that the great festival may come off at \"Household Words\"\ninstead. I am inclined to think it a good idea, and that I shall\ntransfer the locality to that business establishment. But I am at\npresent distracted with doubts and torn by remorse.\n\nThe school-room and dining-room I have brought into habitable condition\nand comfortable appearance. Charley and I breakfast at half-past eight,\nand meet again at dinner when he does not dine in the City, or has no\nengagement. He looks very well.\n\nThe audiences at Gye's are described to me as absolute marvels of\ncoldness. No signs of emotion can be hammered, out of them. Panizzi sat\nnext me at the Academy dinner, and took it very ill that I disparaged\n----. The amateurs here are getting up another pantomime, but quarrel so\nviolently among themselves that I doubt its ever getting on the stage.\nWebster expounded his scheme for rebuilding the Adelphi to Stanfield and\nmyself last night, and I felt bound to tell him that I thought it wrong\nfrom beginning to end. This is all the theatrical news I know.\n\nI write by this post to Georgy. Love to Mamey, Katey, Harry, and the\nnoble Plorn.

W.), and have only just settled down into a corner of the\nschool-room. The extent to which John and I wallowed in dust for four\nhours yesterday morning, getting things neat and comfortable about us,\nyou may faintly imagine. At four in the afternoon came Stanfield, to\nwhom I no sooner described the notion of the new play, than he\nimmediately upset all my new arrangements by making a proscenium of the\nchairs, and planning the scenery with walking-sticks. One of the least\nthings he did was getting on the top of the long table, and hanging over\nthe bar in the middle window where that top sash opens, as if he had got\na hinge in the middle of his body. He is immensely excited on the\nsubject. Mark had a farce ready for the managerial perusal, but it won't\ndo.\n\nI went to the Dover theatre on Friday night, which was a miserable\nspectacle. The pit is boarded over, and it is a drinking and smoking\nplace. It was \"for the benefit of Mrs. ----,\" and the town had been very\nextensively placarded with \"Don't forget Friday.\" I made out four and\nninepence (I am serious) in the house, when I went in. We may have\nwarmed up in the course of the evening to twelve shillings. A Jew played\nthe grand piano; Mrs. ---- sang no end of songs (with not a bad voice,\npoor creature); Mr. ---- sang comic songs fearfully, and danced clog\nhornpipes capitally; and a miserable woman, shivering in a shawl and\nbonnet, sat in the side-boxes all the evening, nursing Master ----, aged\nseven months. It was a most forlorn business, and I should have\ncontributed a sovereign to the treasury, if I had known how.\n\nI walked to Deal and back that day, and on the previous day walked over\nthe downs towards Canterbury in a gale of wind. It was better than still\nweather after all, being wonderfully fresh and free.\n\nIf the Plorn were sitting at this school-room window in the corner, he\nwould see more cats in an hour than he ever saw in his life. _I_ never\nsaw so many, I think, as I have seen since yesterday morning.\n\nThere is a painful picture of a great deal of merit (Egg has bought it)\nin the exhibition, painted by the man who did those little interiors of\nForster's. It is called \"The Death of Chatterton.\" The dead figure is a\ngood deal like Arthur Stone; and I was touched on Saturday to see that\ntender old file standing before it, crying under his spectacles at the\nidea of seeing his son dead. It was a very tender manifestation of his\ngentle old heart.\n\nThis sums up my news, which is no news at all. Kiss the Plorn for me,\nand expound to him that I am always looking forward to meeting him\nagain, among the birds and flowers in the garden on the side of the hill\nat Boulogne.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

But talking to your namesake this\nvery day at dinner, it suddenly entered my head that I would come into\nmy room here as soon as dinner should be over, and write, \"My dear\nLandor, how are you?\" for the pleasure of having the answer under your\nown hand. That you _do_ write, and that pretty often, I know beforehand.\nElse why do I read _The Examiner_?\n\nWe were in Paris from October to May (I perpetually flying between that\ncity and London), and there we found out, by a blessed accident, that\nyour godson was horribly deaf. I immediately consulted the principal\nphysician of the Deaf and Dumb Institution there (one of the best\naurists in Europe), and he kept the boy for three months, and took\nunheard-of pains with him. He is now quite recovered, has done extremely\nwell at school, has brought home a prize in triumph, and will be\neligible to \"go up\" for his India examination soon after next Easter.\nHaving a direct appointment, he will probably be sent out soon after he\nhas passed, and so will fall into that strange life \"up the country,\"\nbefore he well knows he is alive, which indeed seems to be rather an\nadvanced stage of knowledge.\n\nAnd there in Paris, at the same time, I found Marguerite Power and\nLittle Nelly, living with their mother and a pretty sister, in a very\nsmall, neat apartment, and working (as Marguerite told me) hard for a\nliving. All that I saw of them filled me with respect, and revived the\ntenderest remembrances of Gore House. They are coming to pass two or\nthree weeks here for a country rest, next month. We had many long talks\nconcerning Gore House, and all its bright associations; and I can\nhonestly report that they hold no one in more gentle and affectionate\nremembrance than you. Marguerite is still handsome, though she had the\nsmallpox two or three years ago, and bears the traces of it here and\nthere, by daylight.

You were always in\nthe mind of my household during your illness; and to have so beautiful,\nand fresh, and manly an assurance of your recovery from it, under your\nown hand, is a privilege and delight that I will say no more of.\n\nI am so glad you like Flora. It came into my head one day that we have\nall had our Floras, and that it was a half-serious, half-ridiculous\ntruth which had never been told. It is a wonderful gratification to me\nto find that everybody knows her. Indeed, some people seem to think I\nhave done them a personal injury, and that their individual Floras (God\nknows where they are, or who!) are each and all Little Dorrit's.\n\nWe were all grievously disappointed that you were ill when we played Mr.\nCollins's \"Lighthouse\" at my house. If you had been well, I should have\nwaited upon you with my humble petition that you would come and see it;\nand if you had come I think you would have cried, which would have\ncharmed me. I hope to produce another play at home next Christmas, and\nif I can only persuade you to see it from a special arm-chair, and can\nonly make you wretched, my satisfaction will be intense. May I tell you,\nto beguile a moment, of a little \"Tag,\" or end of a piece, I saw in\nParis this last winter, which struck me as the prettiest I had ever met\nwith? The piece was not a new one, but a revival at the Vaudeville--\"Les\nMemoires du Diable.\" Admirably constructed, very interesting, and\nextremely well played. The plot is, that a certain M. Robin has come\ninto possession of the papers of a deceased lawyer, and finds some\nrelating to the wrongful withholding of an estate from a certain\nbaroness, and to certain other frauds (involving even the denial of the\nmarriage to the deceased baron, and the tarnishing of his good name)\nwhich are so very wicked that he binds them up in a book and labels them\n\"Memoires du Diable.\" Armed with this knowledge he goes down to the\ndesolate old chateau in the country--part of the wrested-away\nestate--from which the baroness and her daughter are going to be\nejected. He informs the mother that he can right her and restore the\nproperty, but must have, as his reward, her daughter's hand in marriage.\nShe replies: \"I cannot promise my daughter to a man of whom I know\nnothing. The gain would be an unspeakable happiness, but I resolutely\ndecline the bargain.\" The daughter, however, has observed all, and she\ncomes forward and says: \"Do what you have promised my mother you can do,\nand I am yours.\" Then the piece goes on to its development, in an\nadmirable way, through the unmasking of all the hypocrites. Now, M.\nRobin, partly through his knowledge of the secret ways of the old\nchateau (derived from the lawyer's papers), and partly through his going\nto a masquerade as the devil--the better to explode what he knows on the\nhypocrites--is supposed by the servants at the chateau really to be the\ndevil. At the opening of the last act he suddenly appears there before\nthe young lady, and she screams, but, recovering and laughing, says:\n\"You are not really the ----?\" \"Oh dear no!\" he replies, \"have no\nconnection with him. But these people down here are so frightened and\nabsurd! See this little toy on the table; I open it; here's a little\nbell. They have a notion that whenever this bell rings I shall appear.\nVery ignorant, is it not?\" \"Very, indeed,\" says she. \"Well,\" says M.\nRobin, \"if you should want me very much to appear, try the bell, if only\nfor a jest. Will you promise?\" Yes, she promises, and the play goes on.\nAt last he has righted the baroness completely, and has only to hand\nher the last document, which proves her marriage and restores her good\nname. Then he says: \"Madame, in the progress of these endeavours I have\nlearnt the happiness of doing good for its own sake. I made a necessary\nbargain with you; I release you from it. I have done what I undertook to\ndo. I wish you and your amiable daughter all happiness. Adieu! I take my\nleave.\" Bows himself out. People on the stage astonished. Audience\nastonished--incensed. The daughter is going to cry, when she looks at\nthe box on the table, remembers the bell, runs to it and rings it, and\nhe rushes back and takes her to his heart; upon which we all cry with\npleasure, and then laugh heartily.\n\nThis looks dreadfully long, and perhaps you know it already. If so, I\nwill endeavour to make amends with Flora in future numbers.\n\nMrs. Dickens and her sister beg to present their remembrances to your\nGrace, and their congratulations on your recovery. I saw Paxton now and\nthen when you were ill, and always received from him most encouraging\naccounts. I don't know how heavy he is going to be (I mean in the\nscale), but I begin to think Daniel Lambert must have been in his\nfamily.\n\n                               Ever your Grace's faithful and obliged.",

This is as pretty and odd\na little French country house as could be found anywhere; and the\ngardens are most beautiful.\n\nIn \"Household Words,\" next week, pray read \"The Diary of Anne Rodway\"\n(in two not long parts). It is by Collins, and I think possesses great\nmerit and real pathos.\n\nBeing in town the other day, I saw Gye by accident, and told him, when\nhe praised ---- to me, that she was a very bad actress. \"Well!\" said he,\n\"_you_ may say anything, but if anybody else had told me that I should\nhave stared.\" Nevertheless, I derived an impression from his manner that\nshe had not been a profitable speculation in respect of money. That very\nsame day Stanfield and I dined alone together at the Garrick, and drank\nyour health. We had had a ride by the river before dinner (of course he\n_would_ go and look at boats), and had been talking of you.

I think (recreation\nallowed, etc.), that the play will take that time to write. The ladies\nof the _dram. pers._ are frightfully anxious to get it under way, and to\nsee you locked up in the pavilion; apropos of which noble edifice I have\nomitted to mention that it is made a more secluded retreat than it used\nto be, and is greatly improved by the position of the door being\nchanged. It is as snug and as pleasant as possible; and the Genius of\nOrder has made a few little improvements about the house (at the rate of\nabout tenpence apiece), which the Genius of Disorder will, it is hoped,\nappreciate.\n\nI think I must come over for a small spree, and to fetch you. Suppose I\nwere to come on the 9th or 10th of August to stay three or four days in\ntown, would that do for you? Let me know at the end of this month.\n\nI cannot tell you what a high opinion I have of Anne Rodway. I took\n\"Extracts\" out of the title because it conveyed to the many-headed an\nidea of incompleteness--of something unfinished--and is likely to stall\nsome readers off. I read the first part at the office with strong\nadmiration, and read the second on the railway coming back here, being\nin town just after you had started on your cruise. My behaviour before\nmy fellow-passengers was weak in the extreme, for I cried as much as you\ncould possibly desire. Apart from the genuine force and beauty of the\nlittle narrative, and the admirable personation of the girl's identity\nand point of view, it is done with an amount of honest pains and\ndevotion to the work which few men have better reason to appreciate than\nI, and which no man can have a more profound respect for. I think it\nexcellent, feel a personal pride and pleasure in it which is a\ndelightful sensation, and know no one else who could have done it.\n\nOf myself I have only to report that I have been hard at it with \"Little\nDorrit,\" and am now doing No. 10. This last week I sketched out the\nnotion, characters, and progress of the farce, and sent it off to Mark,\nwho has been ill of an ague. It ought to be very funny. The cat business\nis too ludicrous to be treated of in so small a sheet of paper, so I\nmust describe it _viva voce_ when I come to town. French has been so\ninsufferably conceited since he shot tigerish cat No. 1 (intent on the\nnoble Dick, with green eyes three inches in advance of her head), that I\nam afraid I shall have to part with him. All the boys likewise (in new\nclothes and ready for church) are at this instant prone on their\nstomachs behind bushes, whooshing and crying (after tigerish cat No. 2):\n\"French!\" \"Here she comes!\" \"There she goes!\" etc. I dare not put my\nhead out of window for fear of being shot (it is as like a _coup d'etat_\nas possible), and tradesmen coming up the avenue cry plaintively: \"_Ne\ntirez pas, Monsieur Fleench; c'est moi--boulanger. Ne tirez pas, mon\nami._\"\n\nLikewise I shall have to recount to you the secret history of a robbery\nat the Pavilion at Folkestone, which you will have to write.\n\nTell Piggot, when you see him, that we shall all be much pleased if he\nwill come at his own convenience while you are here, and stay a few days\nwith us.\n\nI shall have more than one notion of future work to suggest to you while\nwe are beguiling the dreariness of an arctic winter in these parts. May\nthey prosper!\n\nKind regards from all to the Dramatic Poet of the establishment, and to\nthe D. P.'s mother and brother.\n\n                                                           Ever yours.\n\nP.S.--If the \"Flying Dutchman\" should be done again, pray do go and see\nit.

The scene with Jason is\nperfectly terrific; and the manner in which the comic rage and jealousy\ndoes not pitch itself over the floor at the stalls is in striking\ncontrast to the manner in which the tragic rage and jealousy does.

WATSON,\n\nI _did_ write it for you; and I hoped in writing it, that you would\nthink so. All those remembrances are fresh in my mind, as they often\nare, and gave me an extraordinary interest in recalling the past. I\nshould have been grievously disappointed if you had not been pleased,\nfor I took aim at you with a most determined intention.\n\nLet me congratulate you most heartily on your handsome Eddy having\npassed his examination with such credit. I am sure there is a spirit\nshining out of his eyes, which will do well in that manly and generous\npursuit. You will naturally feel his departure very much, and so will\nhe; but I have always observed within my experience, that the men who\nhave left home young have, many long years afterwards, had the tenderest\nlove for it, and for all associated with it. That's a pleasant thing to\nthink of, as one of the wise and benevolent adjustments in these lives\nof ours.\n\nI have been so hard at work (and shall be for the next eight or nine\nmonths), that sometimes I fancy I have a digestion, or a head, or\nnerves, or some odd encumbrance of that kind, to which I am altogether\nunaccustomed, and am obliged to rush at some other object for relief; at\npresent the house is in a state of tremendous excitement, on account of\nMr. Collins having nearly finished the new play we are to act at\nChristmas, which is very interesting and extremely clever. I hope this\ntime you will come and see it. We purpose producing it on Charley's\nbirthday, Twelfth Night; but we shall probably play four nights\naltogether--\"The Lighthouse\" on the last occasion--so that if you could\ncome for the two last nights, you would see both the pieces. I am going\nto try and do better than ever, and already the school-room is in the\nhands of carpenters; men from underground habitations in theatres, who\nlook as if they lived entirely upon smoke and gas, meet me at unheard-of\nhours. Mr. Stanfield is perpetually measuring the boards with a chalked\npiece of string and an umbrella, and all the elder children are wildly\npunctual and business-like to attract managerial commendation. If you\ndon't come, I shall do something antagonistic--try to unwrite No. 11, I\nthink. I should particularly like you to see a new and serious piece so\ndone. Because I don't think you know, without seeing, how good it is!!!\n\nNone of the children suffered, thank God, from the Boulogne risk. The\nthree little boys have gone back to school there, and are all well.\nKatey came away ill, but it turned out that she had the whooping-cough\nfor the second time. She has been to Brighton, and comes home to-day. I\nhear great accounts of her, and hope to find her quite well when she\narrives presently. I am afraid Mary Boyle has been praising the Boulogne\nlife too highly. Not that I deny, however, our having passed some very\npleasant days together, and our having had great pleasure in her visit.\n\nYou will object to me dreadfully, I know, with a beard (though not a\ngreat one); but if you come and see the play, you will find it necessary\nthere, and will perhaps be more tolerant of the fearful object\nafterwards. I need not tell you how delighted we should be to see\nGeorge, if you would come together. Pray tell him so, with my kind\nregards. I like the notion of Wentworth and his philosophy of all\nthings. I remember a philosophical gravity upon him, a state of\nsuspended opinion as to myself, it struck me, when we last met, in which\nI thought there was a great deal of oddity and character.\n\nCharley is doing very well at Baring's, and attracting praise and reward\nto himself. Within this fortnight there turned up from the West Indies,\nwhere he is now a chief justice, an old friend of mine, of my own age,\nwho lived with me in lodgings in the Adelphi, when I was just Charley's\nage. He had a great affection for me at that time, and always supposed I\nwas to do some sort of wonders. It was a very pleasant meeting indeed,\nand he seemed to think it so odd that I shouldn't be Charley!\n\nThis is every atom of no-news that will come out of my head, and I\nfirmly believe it is all I have in it--except that a cobbler at\nBoulogne, who had the nicest of little dogs, that always sat in his\nsunny window watching him at work, asked me if I would bring the dog\nhome, as he couldn't afford to pay the tax for him. The cobbler and the\ndog being both my particular friends, I complied. The cobbler parted\nwith the dog heart-broken. When the dog got home here, my man, like an\nidiot as he is, tied him up and then untied him. The moment the gate was\nopen, the dog (on the very day after his arrival) ran out. Next day,\nGeorgy and I saw him lying, all covered with mud, dead, outside the\nneighbouring church. How am I ever to tell the cobbler? He is too poor\nto come to England, so I feel that I must lie to him for life, and say\nthat the dog is fat and happy. Mr. Plornish, much affected by this\ntragedy, said: \"I s'pose, pa, I shall meet the cobbler's dog\" (in\nheaven).\n\nGeorgy and Catherine send their best love, and I send mine. Pray write\nto me again some day, and I can't be too busy to be happy in the sight\nof your familiar hand, associated in my mind with so much that I love\nand honour.\n\n                      Ever, my dear Mr. Watson, most faithfully yours.",

More than that, in spite of your assertions to the contrary, I\nstill strenuously believe that I did so! I have more than half a mind\n(\"Little Dorrit\" and my other occupations notwithstanding) to charge you\nwith having forgotten my reply!! I have even a wild idea that Townshend\nreproached me, when the last old year was new, with writing to you\ninstead of to him!!! We will argue it out, as well as we can argue\nanything without poor dear Haldimand, when I come back to Elys\u00e9e. In any\ncase, however, don't discontinue your annual letter, because it has\nbecome an expected and a delightful part of the season to me.\n\nWith one of the prettiest houses in London, and every conceivable (and\ninconceivable) luxury in it, Townshend is voluntarily undergoing his own\nsentence of transportation in Nervi, a beastly little place near Genoa,\nwhere you would as soon find a herd of wild elephants in any villa as\ncomfort. He has a notion that he _must_ be out of England in the winter,\nbut I believe him to be altogether wrong (as I have just told him in a\nletter), unless he could just take his society with him.\n\nWorkmen are now battering and smashing down my theatre here, where we\nhave just been acting a new play of great merit, done in what I may call\n(modestly speaking of the getting-up, and not of the acting) an\nunprecedented way. I believe that anything so complete has never been\nseen. We had an act at the North Pole, where the slightest and greatest\nthing the eye beheld were equally taken from the books of the Polar\nvoyagers. Out of thirty people, there were certainly not two who might\nnot have gone straight to the North Pole itself, completely furnished\nfor the winter! It has been the talk of all London for these three\nweeks. And now it is a mere chaos of scaffolding, ladders, beams,\ncanvases, paint-pots, sawdust, artificial snow, gas-pipes, and\nghastliness. I have taken such pains with it for these ten weeks in all\nmy leisure hours, that I feel now shipwrecked--as if I had never been\nwithout a play on my hands before. A third topic comes up as this\nceases.\n\nDown at Gad's Hill, near Rochester, in Kent--Shakespeare's Gad's Hill,\nwhere Falstaff engaged in the robbery--is a quaint little country-house\nof Queen Anne's time. I happened to be walking past, a year and a half\nor so ago, with my sub-editor of \"Household Words,\" when I said to him:\n\"You see that house? It has always a curious interest for me, because\nwhen I was a small boy down in these parts I thought it the most\nbeautiful house (I suppose because of its famous old cedar-trees) ever\nseen. And my poor father used to bring me to look at it, and used to say\nthat if I ever grew up to be a clever man perhaps I might own that\nhouse, or such another house. In remembrance of which, I have always in\npassing looked to see if it was to be sold or let, and it has never been\nto me like any other house, and it has never changed at all.\" We came\nback to town, and my friend went out to dinner. Next morning he came to\nme in great excitement, and said: \"It is written that you were to have\nthat house at Gad's Hill. The lady I had allotted to me to take down to\ndinner yesterday began to speak of that neighbourhood. 'You know it?' I\nsaid; 'I have been there to-day.' 'O yes,' said she, 'I know it very\nwell. I was a child there, in the house they call Gad's Hill Place. My\nfather was the rector, and lived there many years. He has just died, has\nleft it to me, and I want to sell it.' 'So,' says the sub-editor, 'you\nmust buy it. Now or never!'\" I did, and hope to pass next summer there,\nthough I may, perhaps, let it afterwards, furnished, from time to time.\n\nAll about myself I find, and the little sheet nearly full! But I know,\nmy dear Cerjat, the subject will have its interest for you, so I give it\nits swing. Mrs. Watson was to have been at the play, but most\nunfortunately had three children sick of gastric fever, and could not\nleave them. She was here some three weeks before, looking extremely well\nin the face, but rather thin. I have not heard of your friend Mr.\nPercival Skelton, but I much misdoubt an amateur artist's success in\nthis vast place. I hope you detected a remembrance of our happy visit to\nthe Great St. Bernard in a certain number of \"Little Dorrit\"? Tell Mrs.\nCerjat, with my love, that the opinions I have expressed to her on the\nsubject of cows have become matured in my mind by experience and\nvenerable age; and that I denounce the race as humbugs, who have been\ngetting into poetry and all sorts of places without the smallest reason.\nHaldimand's housekeeper is an awful woman to consider. Pray give him our\nkindest regards and remembrances, if you ever find him in a mood to take\nit. \"Our\" means Mrs. Dickens's, Georgie's, and mine. We often, often\ntalk of our old days at Lausanne, and send loving regard to Mrs. Cerjat\nand all your house.\n\n                          Adieu, my dear fellow; ever cordially yours.",

I was not in the\nway; but as ---- had come express from London with it, Mrs. Dickens\nopened it, and gave her (in the limited sense which was of no use to\nher) an audience. She did not quite seem to know what she wanted of me.\nBut she said she had understood at Stafford House that I had a theatre\nin which she could read; with a good deal of modesty and diffidence she\nat last got so far. Now, my little theatre turns my house out of window,\ncosts fifty pounds to put up, and is only two months taken down;\ntherefore, is quite out of the question. This Mrs. Dickens explained,\nand also my profound inability to do anything for ---- readings which\nthey could not do for themselves. She appeared fully to understand the\nexplanation, and indeed to have anticipated for herself how powerless I\nmust be in such a case.\n\nShe described herself as being consumptive, and as being subject to an\neffusion of blood from the lungs; about the last condition, one would\nthink, poor woman, for the exercise of public elocution as an art.\n\nBetween ourselves, I think the whole idea a mistake, and have thought so\nfrom its first announcement. It has a fatal appearance of trading upon\nUncle Tom, and am I not a man and a brother? which you may be by all\nmeans, and still not have the smallest claim to my attention as a public\nreader. The town is over-read from all the white squares on the\ndraught-board; it has been considerably harried from all the black\nsquares--now with the aid of old banjoes, and now with the aid of Exeter\nHall; and I have a very strong impression that it is by no means to be\nlaid hold of from this point of address. I myself, for example, am the\nmeekest of men, and in abhorrence of slavery yield to no human creature,\nand yet I don't admit the sequence that I want Uncle Tom (or Aunt\nTomasina) to expound \"King Lear\" to me. And I believe my case to be the\ncase of thousands.\n\nI trouble you with this much about it, because I am naturally desirous\nyou should understand that if I could possibly have been of any service,\nor have suggested anything to this poor lady, I would not have lost the\nopportunity. But I cannot help her, and I assure you that I cannot\nhonestly encourage her to hope. I fear her enterprise has no hope in it.\n\nIn your absence I have always followed you through the papers, and felt\na personal interest and pleasure in the public affection in which you\nare held over there.[2] At the same time I must confess that I should\nprefer to have you here, where good public men seem to me to be dismally\nwanted. I have no sympathy with demagogues, but am a grievous Radical,\nand think the political signs of the times to be just about as bad as\nthe spirit of the people will admit of their being. In all other\nrespects I am as healthy, sound, and happy as your kindness can wish. So\nyou will set down my political despondency as my only disease.\n\nOn the tip-top of Gad's Hill, between this and Rochester, on the very\nspot where Falstaff ran away, I have a pretty little old-fashioned\nhouse, which I shall live in the hope of showing to you one day. Also I\nhave a little story respecting the manner in which it became mine, which\nI hope (on the same occasion in the clouds) to tell you. Until then and\nalways, I am, dear Lord Carlisle,\n\n                                    Yours very faithfully and obliged.",

It gives the\nappearance of perpetual effort, stabs to the heart the nature that is in\nthem, and wearies by the manner and not by the matter. It is the\ncommonest fault in the world (as I have constant occasion to observe\nhere), but it is a very great one. Just as you couldn't bear to have an\n\u00e9pergne or a candlestick on your table, supported by a light figure\nalways on tiptoe and evidently in an impossible attitude for the\nsustainment of its weight, so all readers would be more or less\noppressed and worried by this presentation of everything in one smart\npoint of view, when they know it must have other, and weightier, and\nmore solid properties. Airiness and good spirits are always delightful,\nand are inseparable from notes of a cheerful trip; but they should\nsympathise with many things as well as see them in a lively way. It is\nbut a word or a touch that expresses this humanity, but without that\nlittle embellishment of good nature there is no such thing as humour. In\nthis little MS. everything is too much patronised and condescended to,\nwhereas the slightest touch of feeling for the rustic who is of the\nearth earthy, or of sisterhood with the homely servant who has made her\nface shine in her desire to please, would make a difference that the\nwriter can scarcely imagine without trying it. The only relief in the\ntwenty-one slips is the little bit about the chimes. It _is_ a relief,\nsimply because it is an indication of some kind of sentiment. You don't\nwant any sentiment laboriously made out in such a thing. You don't want\nany maudlin show of it. But you do want a pervading suggestion that it\nis there. It makes all the difference between being playful and being\ncruel. Again I must say, above all things--especially to young people\nwriting: For the love of God don't condescend! Don't assume the attitude\nof saying, \"See how clever I am, and what fun everybody else is!\" Take\nany shape but that.\n\nI observe an excellent quality of observation throughout, and think the\nboy at the shop, and all about him, particularly good. I have no doubt\nwhatever that the rest of the journal will be much better if the writer\nchooses to make it so. If she considers for a moment within herself, she\nwill know that she derived pleasure from everything she saw, because she\nsaw it with innumerable lights and shades upon it, and bound to humanity\nby innumerable fine links; she cannot possibly communicate anything of\nthat pleasure to another by showing it from one little limited point\nonly, and that point, observe, the one from which it is impossible to\ndetach the exponent as the patroness of a whole universe of inferior\nsouls. This is what everybody would mean in objecting to these notes\n(supposing them to be published), that they are too smart and too\nflippant.\n\nAs I understand this matter to be altogether between us three, and as I\nthink your confidence, and hers, imposes a duty of friendship on me, I\ndischarge it to the best of my ability. Perhaps I make more of it than\nyou may have meant or expected; if so, it is because I am interested and\nwish to express it. If there had been anything in my objection not\nperfectly easy of removal, I might, after all, have hesitated to state\nit; but that is not the case. A very little indeed would make all this\ngaiety as sound and wholesome and good-natured in the reader's mind as\nit is in the writer's.\n\n                                                Affectionately always.",

On Thursday, the 30th, or Friday, the 31st, I shall\nprobably read at Manchester. Deane, the general manager of the\nExhibition, is going down to-night, and will arrange all the\npreliminaries for me. If you and I went down to Manchester together, and\nwere there on a Sunday, he would give us the whole Exhibition to\nourselves. It is probable, I think (as he estimates the receipts of a\nnight at about seven hundred pounds), that we may, in about a fortnight\nor so after the reading, play \"The Frozen Deep\" at Manchester. But of\nthis contingent engagement I at present know no more than you do.\n\nNow, will you, upon this exposition of affairs, choose your own time for\ncoming to us, and, when you have made your choice, write to me at Gad's\nHill? I am going down this afternoon for rest (which means violent\ncricket with the boys) after last Saturday night; which was a teaser,\nbut triumphant. The St. Martin's Hall audience was, I must confess, a\nvery extraordinary thing. The two thousand and odd people were like one,\nand their enthusiasm was something awful.\n\nYet I have seen that before, too. Your young remembrance cannot recall\nthe man; but he flourished in my day--a great actor, sir--a noble\nactor--thorough artist! I have seen him do wonders in that way. He\nretired from the stage early in life (having a monomaniacal delusion\nthat he was old), and is said to be still living in your county.\n\nAll join in kindest love to your dear sister and all the rest.\n\n                         Ever, my dearest Macready,\n                                            Most affectionately yours.",

We went up a Cumberland mountain\nyesterday--a huge black hill, fifteen hundred feet high. We took for a\nguide a capital innkeeper hard by. It rained in torrents--as it only\ndoes rain in a hill country--the whole time. At the top, there were\nblack mists and the darkness of night. It then came out that the\ninnkeeper had not been up for twenty years, and he lost his head and\nhimself altogether; and we couldn't get down again! What wonders the\nInimitable performed with his compass until it broke with the heat and\nwet of his pocket no matter; it did break, and then we wandered about,\nuntil it was clear to the Inimitable that the night must be passed\nthere, and the enterprising travellers probably die of cold. We took our\nown way about coming down, struck, and declared that the guide might\nwander where he would, but we would follow a watercourse we lighted\nupon, and which must come at last to the river. This necessitated\namazing gymnastics; in the course of which performances, Collins fell\ninto the said watercourse with his ankle sprained, and the great\nligament of the foot and leg swollen I don't know how big.\n\nHow I enacted Wardour over again in carrying him down, and what a\nbusiness it was to get him down; I may say in Gibbs's words: \"Vi lascio\na giudicare!\" But he was got down somehow, and we got off the mountain\nsomehow; and now I carry him to bed, and into and out of carriages,\nexactly like Wardour in private life. I don't believe he will stand for\na month to come. He has had a doctor, and can wear neither shoe nor\nstocking, and has his foot wrapped up in a flannel waistcoat, and has a\nbreakfast saucer of liniment, and a horrible dabbling of lotion\nincessantly in progress. We laugh at it all, but I doubt very much\nwhether he can go on to Doncaster. It will be a miserable blow to our H.\nW. scheme, and I say nothing about it as yet; but he is really so\ncrippled that I doubt the getting him there. We have resolved to fall\nto work to-morrow morning and begin our writing; and there, for the\npresent, that point rests.\n\nThis is a little place with fifty houses, five bathing-machines, five\ngirls in straw hats, five men in straw hats, and no other company. The\nlittle houses are all in half-mourning--yellow stone on white stone, and\nblack; and it reminds me of what Broadstairs might have been if it had\nnot inherited a cliff, and had been an Irishman. But this is a capital\nlittle homely inn, looking out upon the sea; and we are really very\ncomfortably lodged. I can just stand upright in my bedroom. Otherwise,\nit is a good deal like one of Ballard's top-rooms. We have a very\nobliging and comfortable landlady; and it is a clean nice place in a\nrough wild country. We came here haphazard, but could not have done\nbetter.\n\nWe lay last night at a place called Wigton--also in half-mourning--with\nthe wonderful peculiarity that it had no population, no business, no\nstreets to speak of; but five linendrapers within range of our small\nwindows, one linendraper's next door, and five more linendrapers round\nthe corner. I ordered a night-light in my bedroom. A queer little old\nwoman brought me one of the common Child's night-lights, and seeming to\nthink that I looked at it with interest, said: \"It's joost a vara\nkeeyourious thing, sir, and joost new coom oop. It'll burn awt hoors a'\nend, an no gootther, nor no waste, nor ony sike a thing, if you can\ncreedit what I say, seein' the airticle.\"\n\nOf course _I_ shall go to Doncaster, whether or no (please God), and my\npostage directions to you remain unchanged.

We came back to Carlisle last night (to a capital inn, kept by\nBreach's brother), and came on here to-day. We are on our way to\nDoncaster; but Sabbath observance throws all the trains out; and\nalthough it is not a hundred miles from here, we shall have, as well as\nI can make out the complicated lists of trains, to sleep at Leeds--which\nI particularly detest as an odious place--to-morrow night.\n\nAccustomed as you are to the homage which men delight to render to the\nInimitable, you would be scarcely prepared for the proportions it\nassumes in this northern country. Station-masters assist him to alight\nfrom carriages, deputations await him in hotel entries, innkeepers bow\ndown before him and put him into regal rooms, the town goes down to the\nplatform to see him off, and Collins's ankle goes into the newspapers!!!\n\nIt is a great deal better than it was, and he can get into new hotels\nand up the stairs with two thick sticks, like an admiral in a farce. His\nspirits have improved in a corresponding degree, and he contemplates\ncheerfully the keeping house at Doncaster. I thought (as I told you) he\nwould never have gone there, but he seems quite up to the mark now. Of\ncourse he can never walk out, or see anything of any place. We have done\nour first paper for H. W., and sent it up to the printer's.\n\nThe landlady of the little inn at Allonby lived at Greta Bridge, in\nYorkshire, when I went down there before \"Nickleby,\" and was smuggled\ninto the room to see me, when I was secretly found out. She is an\nimmensely fat woman now. \"But I could tuck my arm round her waist then,\nMr. Dickens,\" the landlord said when she told me the story as I was\ngoing to bed the night before last. \"And can't you do it now,\" I said,\n\"you insensible dog? Look at me! Here's a picture!\" Accordingly, I got\nround as much of her as I could; and this gallant action was the most\nsuccessful I have ever performed, on the whole. I think it was the\ndullest little place I ever entered; and what with the monotony of an\nidle sea, and what with the monotony of another sea in the room\n(occasioned by Collins's perpetually holding his ankle over a pail of\nsalt water, and laving it with a milk jug), I struck yesterday, and came\naway.\n\nWe are in a very remarkable old house here, with genuine old rooms and\nan uncommonly quaint staircase. I have a state bedroom, with two\nenormous red four-posters in it, each as big as Charley's room at Gad's\nHill. Bellew is to preach here to-morrow. \"And we know he is a friend of\nyours, sir,\" said the landlord, when he presided over the serving of the\ndinner (two little salmon trout; a sirloin steak; a brace of partridges;\nseven dishes of sweets; five dishes of dessert, led off by a bowl of\npeaches; and in the centre an enormous bride-cake--\"We always have it\nhere, sir,\" said the landlord, \"custom of the house.\") (Collins turned\npale, and estimated the dinner at half a guinea each.)\n\nThis is the stupidest of letters, but all description is gone, or going,\ninto \"The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices.\"\n\nKiss the darling Plorn, who is often in my thoughts. Best love to\nCharley, Mamey, and Katie.

It moved me more than I could easily tell you, if I were to try.\nExcept \"La Joie fait Peur,\" I have seen nothing nearly so good, and\nthere is a subtlety in the comfortable presentation of the child who is\nto become a devoted woman for Reuben's sake, which goes a long way\nbeyond Madame de Girardin.

A touching idea,\nmost delicately conceived and wrought out by a true artist and poet, in\na spirit of noble, manly generosity, that no one should be able to study\nwithout great emotion.\n\nIt is extremely well acted by all concerned; but Mr. Dillon's\nperformance is really admirable, and deserving of the highest\ncommendation. It is good in these days to see an actor taking such\npains, and expressing such natural and vigorous sentiment. There is only\none thing I should have liked him to change. I am much mistaken if any\nman--least of all any such man--would crush a letter written by the hand\nof the woman he loved. Hold it to his heart unconsciously and look about\nfor it the while, he might; or he might do any other thing with it that\nexpressed a habit of tenderness and affection in association with the\nidea of her; but he would never crush it under any circumstances. He\nwould as soon crush her heart.\n\nYou will see how closely I went with him, by my minding so slight an\nincident in so fine a performance. There is no one who could approach\nhim in it; and I am bound to add that he surprised me as much as he\npleased me.\n\nI think it might be worth while to try the people at the Fran\u00e7ais with\nthe piece. They are very good in one-act plays; such plays take well\nthere, and this seems to me well suited to them.

I thank you,\nmy dear, dear fellow, with my whole soul. I fervently return that\nfriendship and I highly cherish it.\n\nYou want to know all about me? I am still reading in London every\nThursday, and the audiences are very great, and the success immense. On\nthe 2nd of August I am going away on a tour of some four months in\nEngland, Ireland, and Scotland. I shall read, during that time, not\nfewer than four or five times a week. It will be sharp work; but\nprobably a certain musical clinking will come of it, which will mitigate\nthe hardship.\n\nAt this present moment I am on my little Kentish freehold (_not_ in\ntop-boots, and not particularly prejudiced that I know of), looking on\nas pretty a view out of my study window as you will find in a long day's\nEnglish ride. My little place is a grave red brick house (time of George\nthe First, I suppose), which I have added to and stuck bits upon in all\nmanner of ways, so that it is as pleasantly irregular, and as violently\nopposed to all architectural ideas, as the most hopeful man could\npossibly desire. It is on the summit of Gad's Hill. The robbery was\ncommitted before the door, on the man with the treasure, and Falstaff\nran away from the identical spot of ground now covered by the room in\nwhich I write. A little rustic alehouse, called The Sir John Falstaff,\nis over the way--has been over the way, ever since, in honour of the\nevent. Cobham Woods and Park are behind the house; the distant Thames in\nfront; the Medway, with Rochester, and its old castle and cathedral, on\none side. The whole stupendous property is on the old Dover Road, so\nwhen you come, come by the North Kent Railway (not the South-Eastern) to\nStrood or Higham, and I'll drive over to fetch you.\n\nThe blessed woods and fields have done me a world of good, and I am\nquite myself again. The children are all as happy as children can be. My\neldest daughter, Mary, keeps house, with a state and gravity becoming\nthat high position; wherein she is assisted by her sister Katie, and by\nher aunt Georgina, who is, and always has been, like another sister. Two\nbig dogs, a bloodhound and a St. Bernard, direct from a convent of that\nname, where I think you once were, are their principal attendants in the\ngreen lanes. These latter instantly untie the neckerchiefs of all tramps\nand prowlers who approach their presence, so that they wander about\nwithout any escort, and drive big horses in basket-phaetons through\nmurderous bye-ways, and never come to grief. They are very curious about\nyour daughters, and send all kinds of loves to them and to Mrs. Cerjat,\nin which I heartily join.\n\nYou will have read in the papers that the Thames in London is most horrible.\nI have to cross Waterloo or London Bridge to get to the railroad when I\ncome down here, and I can certify that the offensive smells, even in\nthat short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending\nnature. Nobody knows what is to be done; at least everybody knows a\nplan, and everybody else knows it won't do; in the meantime cartloads of\nchloride of lime are shot into the filthy stream, and do something I\nhope. You will know, before you get this, that the American telegraph\nline has parted again, at which most men are sorry, but very few\nsurprised. This is all the news, except that there is an Italian Opera\nat Drury Lane, price eighteenpence to the pit, where Viardot, by far the\ngreatest artist of them all, sings, and which is full when the dear\nopera can't let a box; and except that the weather has been\nexceptionally hot, but is now quite cool. On the top of this hill it has\nbeen cold, actually cold at night, for more than a week past.\n\nI am going over to Rochester to post this letter, and must write another\nto Townshend before I go. My dear Cerjat, I have written lightly\nenough, because I want you to know that I am becoming cheerful and\nhearty. God bless you! I love you, and I know that you love me.\n\n                                  Ever your attached and affectionate.",

It is to be regretted that we\ncannot take the place again on our way back. It was a prodigious cram,\nand we turned away no end of people. But not only that, I think they\nwere the finest audience I have ever read to. I don't think I ever read,\nin some respects, so well; and I never beheld anything like the personal\naffection which they poured out upon me at the end. It was really a very\nremarkable sight, and I shall always look back upon it with pleasure.\n\nLast night here was not so bright. There are quarrels of the strangest\nkind between the Plymouth people and the Stonehouse people. The room is\nat Stonehouse (Tracy says the wrong room; there being a Plymouth room in\nthis hotel, and he being a Plymouthite). We had a fair house, but not at\nall a great one. All the notabilities come this morning to \"Little\nDombey,\" for which we have let one hundred and thirty stalls, which\nlocal admiration of local greatness considers very large. For \"Mrs. Gamp\nand the Boots,\" to-night, we have also a very promising let. But the\nraces are on, and there are two public balls to-night, and the yacht\nsquadron are all at Cherbourg to boot. Arthur is of opinion that \"Two\nSixties\" will do very well for us. I doubt the \"Two Sixties\" myself.\n_Mais nous verrons._\n\nThe room is a very handsome one, but it is on the top of a windy and\nmuddy hill, leading (literally) to nowhere; and it looks (except that it\nis new and _mortary_) as if the subsidence of the waters after the\nDeluge might have left it where it is. I have to go right through the\ncompany to get to the platform. Big doors slam and resound when anybody\ncomes in; and all the company seem afraid of one another. Nevertheless\nthey were a sensible audience last night, and much impressed and\npleased.\n\nTracy is in the room (wandering about, and never finishing a sentence),\nand sends all manner of sea-loves to you and the dear girls. I send all\nmanner of land-loves to you from myself, out of my heart of hearts, and\nalso to my dear Plorn and the boys.\n\nArthur sends his kindest love. He knows only two characters. He is\neither always corresponding, like a Secretary of State, or he is\ntransformed into a rout-furniture dealer of Rathbone Place, and drags\nforms about with the greatest violence, without his coat.\n\nI have no time to add another word.\n\n                         Ever, dearest Georgy, your most affectionate.",

If such a thing can\nbe, they were even quicker and more intelligent than the audience I had\nin Edinburgh. They were so wonderfully good and were so much on the\nalert this morning by nine o'clock for another reading, that we are\ngoing back there at about our Bradford time. I never saw such people.\nAnd the local agent would take no money, and charge no expenses of his\nown.\n\nThis place looks what Plorn would call \"ortily\" dull. Local agent\npredicts, however, \"great satisfaction to Mr. Dickens, and excellent\nattendance.\" I have just been to look at the hall, where everything was\nwrong, and where I have left Arthur making a platform for me out of\ndining-tables.\n\nIf he comes back in time, I am not quite sure but that he is himself\ngoing to write to Gad's Hill. We talk of coming up from Chester _in the\nnight to-morrow, after the reading_; and of showing our precious selves\nat an apparently impossibly early hour in the Gad's Hill breakfast-room\non Saturday morning.\n\nI have not felt the fatigue to any extent worth mentioning; though I\nget, every night, into the most violent heats. We are going to dine at\nthree o'clock (it wants a quarter now) and have not been here two\nhours, so I have seen nothing of Clement.\n\nTell Georgy with my love, that I read in the same room in which we\nacted, but at the end opposite to that where our stage was. We are not\nat the inn where the amateur company put up, but at The Lion, where the\nfair Miss Mitchell was lodged alone. We have the strangest little rooms\n(sitting-room and two bed-rooms all together), the ceilings of which I\ncan touch with my hand. The windows bulge out over the street, as if\nthey were little stern-windows in a ship. And a door opens out of the\nsitting-room on to a little open gallery with plants in it, where one\nleans over a queer old rail, and looks all downhill and slant-wise at\nthe crookedest black and yellow old houses, all manner of shapes except\nstraight shapes. To get into this room we come through a china closet;\nand the man in laying the cloth has actually knocked down, in that\nrepository, two geraniums and Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nI think that's all I have to say, except that at the Wolverhampton\ntheatre they played \"Oliver Twist\" last night (Mr. Toole the Artful\nDodger), \"in consequence of the illustrious author honouring the town\nwith his presence.\" We heard that the device succeeded very well, and\nthat they got a good many people.\n\nJohn's spirits have been equable and good since we rejoined him. Berry\nhas always got something the matter with his digestion--seems to me the\nmale gender of Maria Jolly, and ought to take nothing but Revalenta\nArabica. Bottled ale is not to be got in these parts, and Arthur is\nthrown upon draught.\n\nMy dearest love to Georgy and to Katey, also to Marguerite.

We left Holyhead at one in the morning,\nand got here at six. Arthur was incessantly sick the whole way. I was\nnot sick at all, but was in as healthy a condition otherwise as humanity\nneed be. We are in a beautiful hotel. Our sitting-room is exactly like\nthe drawing-room at the Peschiere in all its dimensions. I never saw two\nrooms so exactly resembling one another in their proportions. Our\nbedrooms too are excellent, and there are baths and all sorts of\ncomforts.\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant is away, and the place looks to me as if its\nprofessional life were away too. Nevertheless, there are numbers of\npeople in the streets. Somehow, I hardly seem to think we are going to\ndo enormously here; but I have scarcely any reason for supposing so\n(except that a good many houses are shut up); and I _know_ nothing about\nit, for Arthur is now gone to the agent and to the room. The men came by\nboat direct from Liverpool. They had a rough passage, were all ill, and\ndid not get here till noon yesterday. Donnybrook Fair, or what remains\nof it, is going on, within two or three miles of Dublin. They went out\nthere yesterday in a jaunting-car, and John described it to us at\ndinner-time (with his eyebrows lifted up, and his legs well asunder), as\n\"Johnny Brooks's Fair;\" at which Arthur, who was drinking bitter ale,\nnearly laughed himself to death. Berry is always unfortunate, and when I\nasked what had happened to Berry on board the steamboat, it appeared\nthat \"an Irish gentleman which was drunk, and fancied himself the\ncaptain, wanted to knock Berry down.\"\n\nI am surprised by finding this place very much larger than I had\nsupposed it to be. Its bye-parts are bad enough, but cleaner, too, than\nI had supposed them to be, and certainly very much cleaner than the old\ntown of Edinburgh. The man who drove our jaunting-car yesterday hadn't a\npiece in his coat as big as a penny roll, and had had his hat on\n(apparently without brushing it) ever since he was grown up. But he was\nremarkably intelligent and agreeable, with something to say about\neverything. For instance, when I asked him what a certain building was,\nhe didn't say \"courts of law\" and nothing else, but: \"Av you plase, sir,\nit's the foor coorts o' looyers, where Misther O'Connell stood his trial\nwunst, ye'll remimber, sir, afore I tell ye of it.\" When we got into the\nPhoenix Park, he looked round him as if it were his own, and said:\n\"THAT'S a park, sir, av yer plase.\" I complimented it, and he said:\n\"Gintlemen tills me as they'r bin, sir, over Europe, and never see a\npark aqualling ov it. 'Tis eight mile roond, sir, ten mile and a half\nlong, and in the month of May the hawthorn trees are as beautiful as\nbrides with their white jewels on. Yonder's the vice-regal lodge, sir;\nin them two corners lives the two sicretirries, wishing I was them, sir.\nThere's air here, sir, av yer plase! There's scenery here, sir! There's\nmountains--thim, sir! Yer coonsider it a park, sir? It is that, sir!\"\n\nYou should have heard John in my bedroom this morning endeavouring to\nimitate a bath-man, who had resented his interference, and had said as\nto the shower-bath: \"Yer'll not be touching _that_, young man. Divil a\ntouch yer'll touch o' that insthrument, young man!\" It was more\nridiculously unlike the reality than I can express to you, yet he was so\ndelighted with his powers that he went off in the absurdest little\ngingerbeery giggle, backing into my portmanteau all the time.\n\nMy dear love to Katie and to Georgy, also to the noble Plorn and all the\nboys. I shall write to Katie next, and then to Aunty. My cold, I am\nhappy to report, is very much better. I lay in the wet all night on\ndeck, on board the boat, but am not as yet any the worse for it. Arthur\nwas quite insensible when we got to Dublin, and stared at our luggage\nwithout in the least offering to claim it. He left his kindest love for\nall before he went out. I will keep the envelope open until he comes in.\n\n                             Ever, my dearest Mamie,\n                                        Your most affectionate Father.",

We had a very good house last night, after all, that is to say, a\ngreat rush of shillings and good half-crowns, though the stalls were\ncomparatively few. For \"Little Dombey,\" this morning, we have an immense\nstall let--already more than two hundred--and people are now fighting in\nthe agent's shop to take more. Through some mistake of our printer's,\nthe evening reading for this present Wednesday was dropped, in a great\npart of the announcements, and the agent opened no plan for it. I have\ntherefore resolved not to have it at all. Arthur Smith has waylaid me\nin all manner of ways, but I remain obdurate. I am frightfully tired,\nand really relieved by the prospect of an evening--overjoyed.\n\nThey were a highly excitable audience last night, but they certainly did\nnot comprehend--internally and intellectually comprehend--\"The Chimes\"\nas a London audience do. I am quite sure of it. I very much doubt the\nIrish capacity of receiving the pathetic; but of their quickness as to\nthe humorous there can be no doubt. I shall see how they go along with\nLittle Paul, in his death, presently.\n\nWhile I was at breakfast this morning, a general officer was announced\nwith great state--having a staff at the door--and came in, booted and\nplumed, and covered with Crimean decorations. It was Cunninghame, whom\nwe knew in Genoa--then a captain. He was very hearty indeed, and came to\nask me to dinner. Of course I couldn't go. Olliffe has a brother at\nCork, who has just now (noon) written to me, proposing dinners and\nexcursions in that neighbourhood which would fill about a week; I being\nthere a day and a half, and reading three times. The work will be very\nsevere here, and I begin to feel depressed by it. (By \"here,\" I mean\nIreland generally, please to observe.)\n\nWe meant, as I said in a letter to Katie, to go to Queenstown yesterday\nand bask on the seashore. But there is always so much to do that we\ncouldn't manage it after all. We expect a tremendous house to-morrow\nnight as well as to-day; and Arthur is at the present instant up to his\neyes in business (and seats), and, between his regret at losing\nto-night, and his desire to make the room hold twice as many as it\n_will_ hold, is half distracted. I have become a wonderful\nIrishman--must play an Irish part some day--and his only relaxation is\nwhen I enact \"John and the Boots,\" which I consequently do enact all day\nlong. The papers are full of remarks upon my white tie, and describe it\nas being of enormous size, which is a wonderful delusion, because, as\nyou very well know, it is a small tie. Generally, I am happy to report,\nthe Emerald press is in favour of my appearance, and likes my eyes. But\none gentleman comes out with a letter at Cork, wherein he says that\nalthough only forty-six I look like an old man. _He_ is a rum customer,\nI think.\n\nThe Rutherfords are living here, and wanted me to dine with them, which,\nI needn't say, could not be done; all manner of people have called, but\nI have seen only two. John has given it up altogether as to rivalry with\nthe Boots, and did not come into my room this morning at all. Boots\nappeared triumphant and alone. He was waiting for me at the hotel-door\nlast night. \"Whaa't sart of a hoose, sur?\" he asked me. \"Capital.\" \"The\nLard be praised fur the 'onor o' Dooblin!\"\n\nArthur buys bad apples in the streets and brings them home and doesn't\neat them, and then I am obliged to put them in the balcony because they\nmake the room smell faint. Also he meets countrymen with honeycomb on\ntheir heads, and leads them (by the buttonhole when they have one) to\nthis gorgeous establishment and requests the bar to buy honeycomb for\nhis breakfast; then it stands upon the sideboard uncovered and the flies\nfall into it. He buys owls, too, and castles, and other horrible\nobjects, made in bog-oak (that material which is not appreciated at\nGad's Hill); and he is perpetually snipping pieces out of newspapers and\nsending them all over the world. While I am reading he conducts the\ncorrespondence, and his great delight is to show me seventeen or\neighteen letters when I come, exhausted, into the retiring-place. Berry\nhas not got into any particular trouble for forty-eight hours, except\nthat he is all over boils. I have prescribed the yeast, but\nineffectually. It is indeed a sight to see him and John sitting in\npay-boxes, and surveying Ireland out of pigeon-holes.\n\n                                       _Same Evening before Bed-time._\n\nEverybody was at \"Little Dombey\" to-day, and although I had some little\ndifficulty to work them up in consequence of the excessive crowding of\nthe place, and the difficulty of shaking the people into their seats,\nthe effect was unmistakable and profound. The crying was universal, and\nthey were extraordinarily affected. There is no doubt we could stay here\na week with that one reading, and fill the place every night. Hundreds\nof people have been there to-night, under the impression that it would\ncome off again. It was a most decided and complete success.\n\nArthur has been imploring me to stop here on the Friday after Limerick,\nand read \"Little Dombey\" again. But I have positively said \"No.\" The\nwork is too hard. It is not like doing it in one easy room, and always\nthe same room. With a different place every night, and a different\naudience with its own peculiarity every night, it is a tremendous\nstrain. I was sick of it to-day before I began, then got myself into\nwonderful train.\n\nHere follows a dialogue (but it requires imitation), which I had\nyesterday morning with a little boy of the house--landlord's son, I\nsuppose--about Plorn's age. I am sitting on the sofa writing, and find\nhim sitting beside me.\n\n        INIMITABLE. Holloa, old chap.\n\n        YOUNG IRELAND. Hal-loo!\n\n        INIMITABLE (_in his delightful way_).

You\n        learn only words of one syllable.\n\n        YOUNG IRELAND (_laughs heartily_). You may say\n        that it is mostly wureds of one sillibil.\n\n        INIMITABLE.

I seem to be\nalways either in a railway carriage, or reading, or going to bed. I get\nso knocked up, whenever I have a minute to remember it, that then I go\nto bed as a matter of course.\n\nI send my love to the noble Plorn, and to all the boys.

I know all about\nit.\" The moment I had come out of the door of the hotel (a mile off), I\nhad come against the stream of people turned away. I had struggled\nagainst it to the room. There, the crowd in all the lobbies and passages\nwas so great, that I had a difficulty in getting in. They had broken all\nthe glass in the pay-boxes. They had offered frantic prices for stalls.\nEleven bank-notes were thrust into that pay-box (Arthur saw them) at one\ntime, for eleven stalls. Our men were flattened against walls, and\nsqueezed against beams. Ladies stood all night with their chins against\nmy platform. Other ladies sat all night upon my steps. You never saw\nsuch a sight. And the reading went tremendously! It is much to be\nregretted that we troubled ourselves to go anywhere else in Ireland. We\nturned away people enough to make immense houses for a week.\n\nWe arrived here yesterday at two. The room will not hold more than from\neighty to ninety pounds. The same scene was repeated with the additional\nfeature, that the people are much rougher here than in Dublin, and that\nthere was a very great uproar at the opening of the doors, which, the\npolice in attendance being quite inefficient and only looking on, it was\nimpossible to check. Arthur was in the deepest misery because shillings\ngot into stalls, and half-crowns got into shillings, and stalls got\nnowhere, and there was immense confusion. It ceased, however, the moment\nI showed myself; and all went most brilliantly, in spite of a great\npiece of the cornice of the ceiling falling with a great crash within\nfour or five inches of the head of a young lady on my platform (I was\nobliged to have people there), and in spite of my gas suddenly going out\nat the time of the game of forfeits at Scrooge's nephew's, through some\nBelfastian gentleman accidentally treading on the flexible pipe, and\nneeding to be relighted.\n\nWe shall not get to Cork before mid-day on Monday; it being difficult to\nget from here on a Sunday. We hope to be able to start away to-morrow\nmorning to see the Giant's Causeway (some sixteen miles off), and in\nthat case we shall sleep at Dublin to-morrow night, leaving here by the\ntrain at half-past three in the afternoon. Dublin, you must understand,\nis on the way to Cork. This is a fine place, surrounded by lofty hills.\nThe streets are very wide, and the place is very prosperous. The whole\nride from Dublin here is through a very picturesque and various country;\nand the amazing thing is, that it is all particularly neat and orderly,\nand that the houses (outside at all events) are all brightly whitewashed\nand remarkably clean. I want to climb one of the neighbouring hills\nbefore this morning's \"Dombey.\" I am now waiting for Arthur, who has\ngone to the bank to remit his last accumulation of treasure to London.\n\nOur men are rather indignant with the Irish crowds, because in the\nstruggle they don't sell books, and because, in the pressure, they can't\nforce a way into the room afterwards to sell them. They are deeply\ninterested in the success, however, and are as zealous and ardent as\npossible. I shall write to Katie next. Give her my best love, and kiss\nthe darling Plorn for me, and give my love to all the boys.\n\n                       Ever, my dearest Mamie,\n                                        Your most affectionate Father.",

You will\nfind it a wretchedly stupid letter; but you may imagine, my dearest\ngirl, that I am tired.\n\nThe success at Belfast has been equal to the success here. Enormous! We\nturned away half the town. I think them a better audience, on the whole,\nthan Dublin; and the personal affection there was something\noverwhelming. I wish you and the dear girls could have seen the people\nlook at me in the street; or heard them ask me, as I hurried to the\nhotel after reading last night, to \"do me the honour to shake hands,\nMisther Dickens, and God bless you, sir; not ounly for the light you've\nbeen to me this night, but for the light you've been in mee house, sir\n(and God love your face), this many a year.\" Every night, by-the-bye,\nsince I have been in Ireland, the ladies have beguiled John out of the\nbouquet from my coat. And yesterday morning, as I had showered the\nleaves from my geranium in reading \"Little Dombey,\" they mounted the\nplatform, after I was gone, and picked them all up as keepsakes!\n\nI have never seen _men_ go in to cry so undisguisedly as they did at\nthat reading yesterday afternoon. They made no attempt whatever to hide\nit, and certainly cried more than the women. As to the \"Boots\" at night,\nand \"Mrs. Gamp\" too, it was just one roar with me and them; for they\nmade me laugh so that sometimes I _could not_ compose my face to go on.\n\nYou must not let the new idea of poor dear Landor efface the former\nimage of the fine old man. I wouldn't blot him out, in his tender\ngallantry, as he sat upon that bed at Forster's that night, for a\nmillion of wild mistakes at eighty years of age.\n\nI hope to be at Tavistock House before five o'clock next Saturday\nmorning, and to lie in bed half the day, and come home by the 10.50 on\nSunday.\n\nTell the girls that Arthur and I have each ordered at Belfast a trim,\nsparkling, slap-up _Irish jaunting-car_!!! I flatter myself we shall\nastonish the Kentish people. It is the oddest carriage in the world, and\nyou are always falling off. But it is gay and bright in the highest\ndegree. Wonderfully Neapolitan.\n\nWhat with a sixteen mile ride before we left Belfast, and a sea-beach\nwalk, and a two o'clock dinner, and a seven hours' railway ride since, I\nam--as we say here--\"a thrifle weary.\" But I really am in wonderful\nforce, considering the work. For which I am, as I ought to be, very\nthankful.\n\nArthur was exceedingly unwell last night--could not cheer up at all. He\nwas so very unwell that he left the hall(!) and became invisible after\nmy five minutes' rest. I found him at the hotel in a jacket and\nslippers, and with a hot bath just ready. He was in the last stage of\nprostration. The local agent was with me, and proposed that he (the\nwretched Arthur) should go to his office and balance the accounts then\nand there. He went, in the jacket and slippers, and came back in twenty\nminutes, _perfectly well_, in consequence of the admirable balance. He\nis now sitting opposite to me ON THE BAG OF SILVER, forty pounds (it\nmust be dreadfully hard), writing to Boulogne.\n\nI suppose it is clear that the next letter I write is Katie's. Either\nfrom Cork or from Limerick, it shall report further.

I come last (and direct--a pretty hard journey) from Limerick.\nThe success in Ireland has been immense.\n\nThe work is very hard, sometimes overpowering; but I am none the worse\nfor it, and arrived here quite fresh.\n\nSecondly, will you let me recommend the enclosed letter from Wigan, as\nthe groundwork of a capital article, in your way, for H. W.? There is\nnot the least objection to a plain reference to him, or to Phelps, to\nwhom the same thing happened a year or two ago, near Islington, in the\ncase of a clever and capital little daughter of his. I think it a\ncapital opportunity for a discourse on gentility, with a glance at those\nother schools which advertise that the \"sons of gentlemen only\" are\nadmitted, and a just recognition of the greater liberality of our public\nschools. There are tradesmen's sons at Eton, and Charles Kean was at\nEton, and Macready (also an actor's son) was at Rugby. Some such title\nas \"Scholastic Flunkeydom,\" or anything infinitely contemptuous, would\nhelp out the meaning. Surely such a schoolmaster must swallow all the\nsilver forks that the pupils are expected to take when they come, and\nare not expected to take away with them when they go. And of course he\ncould not exist, unless he had flunkey customers by the dozen.\n\nSecondly--no, this is thirdly now--about the Christmas number. I have\narranged so to stop my readings, as to be available for it on _the 15th\nof November_, which will leave me time to write a good article, if I\nclear my way to one. Do you see your way to our making a Christmas\nnumber of this idea that I am going very briefly to hint? Some\ndisappointed person, man or woman, prematurely disgusted with the world,\nfor some reason or no reason (the person should be young, I think)\nretires to an old lonely house, or an old lonely mill, or anything you\nlike, with one attendant, resolved to shut out the world, and hold no\ncommunion with it. The one attendant sees the absurdity of the idea,\npretends to humour it, but really thus to slaughter it. Everything that\nhappens, everybody that comes near, every breath of human interest that\nfloats into the old place from the village, or the heath, or the four\ncross-roads near which it stands, and from which belated travellers\nstray into it, shows beyond mistake that you can't shut out the world;\nthat you are in it, to be of it; that you get into a false position the\nmoment you try to sever yourself from it; and that you must mingle with\nit, and make the best of it, and make the best of yourself into the\nbargain.\n\nIf we could plot out a way of doing this together, I would not be afraid\nto take my part. If we could not, could we plot out a way of doing it,\nand taking in stories by other hands? If we could not do either (but I\nthink we could), shall we fall back upon a round of stories again? That\nI would rather not do, if possible. Will you think about it?\n\nAnd can you come and dine at Tavistock House _on Monday, the 20th\nSeptember, at half-past five_? I purpose being at home there with the\ngirls that day.\n\nAnswer this, according to my printed list for the week. I am off to\nHuddersfield on Wednesday morning.\n\nI think I will now leave off; merely adding that I have got a splendid\nbrogue (it really is exactly like the people), and that I think of\ncoming out as the only legitimate successor of poor Power.\n\n                           Ever, my dear Wilkie, affectionately yours.",

All kinds of applications have\nbeen made for another reading there, and no doubt it would be\nexceedingly productive; but it cannot be done. At Harrogate yesterday;\nthe queerest place, with the strangest people in it, leading the oddest\nlives of dancing, newspaper reading, and tables d'hote. The piety of\nYork obliging us to leave that place for this at six this morning, and\nthere being no night train from Harrogate, we had to engage a special\nengine. We got to bed at one, and were up again before five; which,\nafter yesterday's fatigues, leaves me a little worn out at this present.\n\nI have no accounts of this place as yet, nor have I received any letter\nhere. But the post of this morning is not yet delivered, I believe. We\nhave a charming room, overlooking the sea. Leech is here (living within\na few doors), with the partner of his bosom, and his young family. I\nwrite at ten in the morning, having been here two hours; and you will\nreadily suppose that I have not seen him.\n\nOf news, I have not the faintest breath. I seem to have been doing\nnothing all my life but riding in railway-carriages and reading. The\nrailway of the morning brought us through Castle Howard, and under the\nwoods of Easthorpe, and then just below Malton Abbey, where I went to\npoor Smithson's funeral. It was a most lovely morning, and, tired as I\nwas, I couldn't sleep for looking out of window.\n\nYesterday, at Harrogate, two circumstances occurred which gave Arthur\ngreat delight. Firstly, he chafed his legs sore with his black bag of\nsilver. Secondly, the landlord asked him as a favour, \"If he could\noblige him with a little silver.\" He obliged him directly with some\nforty pounds' worth; and I suspect the landlord to have repented of\nhaving approached the subject. After the reading last night we walked\nover the moor to the railway, three miles, leaving our men to follow\nwith the luggage in a light cart. They passed us just short of the\nrailway, and John was making the night hideous and terrifying the\nsleeping country, by _playing the horn_ in prodigiously horrible and\nunmusical blasts.\n\nMy dearest love, of course, to the dear girls, and to the noble Plorn.\nApropos of children, there was one gentleman at the \"Little Dombey\"\nyesterday morning, who exhibited, or rather concealed, the profoundest\ngrief. After crying a good deal without hiding it, he covered his face\nwith both his hands, and laid it down on the back of the seat before\nhim, and really shook with emotion. He was not in mourning, but I\nsupposed him to have lost some child in old time. There was a remarkably\ngood fellow of thirty or so, too, who found something so very ludicrous\nin \"Toots,\" that he _could not_ compose himself at all, but laughed\nuntil he sat wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. And whenever he felt\n\"Toots\" coming again he began to laugh and wipe his eyes afresh, and\nwhen he came he gave a kind of cry, as if it were too much for him. It\nwas uncommonly droll, and made me laugh heartily.\n\n                            Ever, dear Georgy, your most affectionate.",

I would recommend your seeing the\npoor railway man again and giving him ten shillings, and telling him to\nlet you see him again in about a week. If he be then still unable to\nlift weights and handle heavy things, I would then give him another ten\nshillings, and so on.\n\nSince I wrote to Georgy from Scarborough, we have had, thank God,\nnothing but success. The Hull people (not generally considered\nexcitable, even on their own showing) were so enthusiastic, that we were\nobliged to promise to go back there for two readings. I have positively\nresolved not to lengthen out the time of my tour, so we are now\narranging to drop some small places, and substitute Hull again and York\nagain. But you will perhaps have heard this in the main from Arthur. I\nknow he wrote to you after the reading last night. This place I have\nalways doubted, knowing that we should come here when it was recovering\nfrom the double excitement of the festival and the Queen. But there is a\nvery large hall let indeed, and the prospect of to-night consequently\nlooks bright.\n\nArthur told you, I suppose, that he had his shirt-front and waistcoat\ntorn off last night? He was perfectly enraptured in consequence. Our men\ngot so knocked about that he gave them five shillings apiece on the\nspot. John passed several minutes upside down against a wall, with his\nhead amongst the people's boots. He came out of the difficulty in an\nexceedingly touzled condition, and with his face much flushed. For all\nthis, and their being packed as you may conceive they would be packed,\nthey settled down the instant I went in, and never wavered in the\nclosest attention for an instant. It was a very high room, and required\na great effort.\n\nOddly enough, I slept in this house three days last year with Wilkie.\nArthur has the bedroom I occupied then, and I have one two doors from\nit, and Gordon has the one between. Not only is he still with us, but he\n_has_ talked of going on to Manchester, going on to London, and coming\nback with us to Darlington next Tuesday!!!\n\nThese streets look like a great circus with the season just finished.\nAll sorts of garish triumphal arches were put up for the Queen, and they\nhave got smoky, and have been looked out of countenance by the sun, and\nare blistered and patchy, and half up and half down, and are hideous to\nbehold. Spiritless men (evidently drunk for some time in the royal\nhonour) are slowly removing them, and on the whole it is more like the\nclearing away of \"The Frozen Deep\" at Tavistock House than anything\nwithin your knowledge--with the exception that we are not in the least\nsorry, as we were then. Vague ideas are in Arthur's head that when we\ncome back to Hull, we are to come here, and are to have the Town Hall (a\nbeautiful building), and read to the million. I can't say yet. That\ndepends. I remember that when I was here before (I came from Rockingham\nto make a speech), I thought them a dull and slow audience. I hope I may\nhave been mistaken. I never saw better audiences than the Yorkshire\naudiences generally.\n\nI am so perpetually at work or asleep, that I have not a scrap of news.\nI saw the Leech family at Scarboro', both in my own house (that is to\nsay, hotel) and in theirs. They were not at either reading. Scarboro' is\ngay and pretty, and I think Gordon had an idea that we were always at\nsome such place.\n\nKiss the darling Plorn for me, and give him my love; dear Katie too,\ngiving her the same. I feel sorry that I cannot get down to Gad's Hill\nthis next time, but I shall look forward to our being there with Georgy,\nafter Scotland.

How the densest and\nmost uncomfortably-packed crowd will be hushed in an instant when I show\nmy face. How the youth of colleges, and the old men of business in the\ntown, seem equally unable to get near enough to me when they cheer me\naway at night. How common people and gentlefolks will stop me in the\nstreets and say: \"Mr. Dickens, will you let me touch the hand that has\nfilled my home with so many friends?\" And if you saw the mothers, and\nfathers, and sisters, and brothers in mourning, who invariably come to\n\"Little Dombey,\" and if you studied the wonderful expression of comfort\nand reliance with which they hang about me, as if I had been with them,\nall kindness and delicacy, at their own little death-bed, you would\nthink it one of the strangest things in the world.\n\nAs to the mere effect, of course I don't go on doing the thing so often\nwithout carefully observing myself and the people too in every little\nthing, and without (in consequence) greatly improving in it.\n\nAt Aberdeen, we were crammed to the street twice in one day. At Perth\n(where I thought when I arrived there literally could be nobody to\ncome), the nobility came posting in from thirty miles round, and the\nwhole town came and filled an immense hall. As to the effect, if you had\nseen them after Lilian died, in \"The Chimes,\" or when Scrooge woke and\ntalked to the boy outside the window, I doubt if you would ever have\nforgotten it. And at the end of \"Dombey\" yesterday afternoon, in the\ncold light of day, they all got up, after a short pause, gentle and\nsimple, and thundered and waved their hats with that astonishing\nheartiness and fondness for me, that for the first time in all my public\ncareer they took me completely off my legs, and I saw the whole eighteen\nhundred of them reel on one side as if a shock from without had shaken\nthe hall.\n\nThe dear girls have enjoyed themselves immensely, and their trip has\nbeen a great success. I hope I told you (but I forget whether I did or\nno) how splendidly Newcastle[4] came out. I am reminded of Newcastle at\nthe moment because they joined me there.\n\nI am anxious to get to the end of my readings, and to be at home again,\nand able to sit down and think in my own study. But the fatigue, though\nsometimes very great indeed, hardly tells upon me at all. And although\nall our people, from Smith downwards, have given in, more or less, at\ntimes, I have never been in the least unequal to the work, though\nsometimes sufficiently disinclined for it.

They have one fatal mistake, which is a canker at the foot\nof their ever being widely useful.

But so to resent this miserable\nerror, or to (by any implication) depreciate the divine goodness and\nbeauty of the New Testament, is to commit even a worse error. And to\nclass Jesus Christ with Mahomet is simply audacity and folly.

Apart\nfrom the high sense I have of the affectionate confidence with which you\ntell me what lies so tenderly on your own heart, I have followed the\nlittle history with a lively sympathy and regard for her. I hope, with\nyou, that it is full of promise, and that you will all be happy in it.\nThe separation, even in the present condition of travel (and no man can\nsay how much the discovery of a day may advance it), is nothing. And so\nGod bless her and all of you, and may the rosy summer bring her all the\nfulness of joy that we all wish her.\n\nTo pass from the altar to Townshend (which is a long way), let me report\nhim severely treated by Bully, who rules him with a paw of iron; and\ncomplaining, moreover, of indigestion. He drives here every Sunday, but\nat all other times is mostly shut up in his beautiful house, where I\noccasionally go and dine with him _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_, and where we always\ntalk of you and drink to you. That is a rule with us from which we never\ndepart. He is \"seeing a volume of poems through the press;\" rather an\nexpensive amusement. He has not been out at night (except to this house)\nsave last Friday, when he went to hear me read \"The Poor Traveller,\"\n\"Mrs. Gamp,\" and \"The Trial\" from \"Pickwick.\" He came into my room at\nSt. Martin's Hall, and I fortified him with weak brandy-and-water. You\nwill be glad to hear that the said readings are a greater _furore_ than\nthey ever have been, and that every night on which they now take\nplace--once a week--hundreds go away, unable to get in, though the hall\nholds thirteen hundred people. I dine with ---- to-day, by-the-bye,\nalong with his agent; concerning whom I observe him to be always divided\nbetween an unbounded confidence and a little latent suspicion. He always\ntells me that he is a gem of the first water; oh yes, the best of\nbusiness men! and then says that he did not quite like his conduct\nrespecting that farm-tenant and those hay-ricks.\n\nThere is a general impression here, among the best-informed, that war in\nItaly, to begin with, is inevitable, and will break out before April. I\nknow a gentleman at Genoa (Swiss by birth), deeply in with the\nauthorities at Turin, who is already sending children home.\n\nIn England we are quiet enough. There is a world of talk, as you know,\nabout Reform bills; but I don't believe there is any general strong\nfeeling on the subject. According to my perceptions, it is undeniable\nthat the public has fallen into a state of indifference about public\naffairs, mainly referable, as I think, to the people who administer\nthem--and there I mean the people of all parties--which is a very bad\nsign of the times. The general mind seems weary of debates and\nhonourable members, and to have taken _laissez-aller_ for its motto.\n\nMy affairs domestic (which I know are not without their interest for\nyou) flow peacefully. My eldest daughter is a capital housekeeper, heads\nthe table gracefully, delegates certain appropriate duties to her sister\nand her aunt, and they are all three devotedly attached. Charley, my\neldest boy, remains in Barings' house. Your present correspondent is\nmore popular than he ever has been. I rather think that the readings in\nthe country have opened up a new public who were outside before; but\nhowever that may be, his books have a wider range than they ever had,\nand his public welcomes are prodigious. Said correspondent is at present\noverwhelmed with proposals to go and read in America. Will never go,\nunless a small fortune be first paid down in money on this side of the\nAtlantic. Stated the figure of such payment, between ourselves, only\nyesterday. Expects to hear no more of it, and assuredly will never go\nfor less. You don't say, my dear Cerjat, when you are coming to England!\nSomehow I feel that this marriage ought to bring you over, though I\ndon't know why. You shall have a bed here and a bed at Gad's Hill, and\nwe will go and see strange sights together. When I was in Ireland, I\nordered the brightest jaunting-car that ever was seen. It has just this\nminute arrived per steamer from Belfast. Say you are coming, and you\nshall be the first man turned over by it; somebody must be (for my\ndaughter Mary drives anything that can be harnessed, and I know of no\nEnglish horse that would understand a jaunting-car coming down a Kentish\nhill), and you shall be that somebody if you will. They turned the\nbasket-phaeton over, last summer, in a bye-road--Mary and the other\ntwo--and had to get it up again; which they did, and came home as if\nnothing had happened. They send their loves to Mrs. Cerjat, and to you,\nand to all, and particularly to the dear _fianc\u00e9e_. So do I, with all my\nheart, and am ever your attached and affectionate friend.",

I\nthink you will have no difficulty in believing that I would not, on any\nconsideration, obtrude my name or projects upon any one of those noble\nsouls, if there were any reason of the slightest kind against it. And if\nyou see any such reason, I pray you instantly to banish my letter from\nyour thoughts.\n\nIt seems to me probable that some narrative of their ten years'\nsuffering will, somehow or other, sooner or later, be by some of them\nlaid before the English people. The just interest and indignation alive\nhere, will (I suppose) elicit it. False narratives and garbled stories\nwill, in any case, of a certainty get about. If the true history of the\nmatter is to be told, I have that sympathy with them and respect for\nthem which would, all other considerations apart, render it unspeakably\ngratifying to me to be the means of its diffusion. What I desire to lay\nbefore them is simply this. If for my new successor to \"Household Words\"\na narrative of their ten years' trial could be written, I would take any\nconceivable pains to have it rendered into English, and presented in the\nsincerest and best way to a very large and comprehensive audience. It\nshould be published exactly as you might think best for them, and\nremunerated in any way that you might think generous and right. They\nwant no mouthpiece and no introducer, but perhaps they might have no\nobjection to be associated with an English writer, who is possibly not\nunknown to them by some general reputation, and who certainly would be\nanimated by a strong public and private respect for their honour,\nspirit, and unmerited misfortunes. This is the whole matter; assuming\nthat such a thing is to be done, I long for the privilege of helping to\ndo it. These gentlemen might consider it an independent means of making\nmoney, and I should be delighted to pay the money.\n\nIn my absence from town, my friend and sub-editor, Mr. Wills (to whom I\nhad expressed my feeling on the subject), has seen, I think, three of\nthe gentlemen together. But as I hear, returning home to-night, that\nthey are in your good hands, and as nobody can be a better judge than\nyou of anything that concerns them, I at once decide to write to you and\nto take no other step whatever. Forgive me for the trouble I have\noccasioned you in the reading of this letter, and never think of it\nagain if you think that by pursuing it you would cause them an instant's\nuneasiness.\n\n                                    Believe me, very faithfully yours.",

Apart from this singular\ndelusion of yours, and wholly unaccountable departure from your usual\naccuracy in all things, your satisfaction with the portrait is a great\npleasure to me.

You should see some charming woods and a rare old castle, and you\nshould have such a snug room looking over a Kentish prospect, with every\nfacility in it for pondering on the beauties of its master's beard! _Do_\ncome, but you positively _must not_ come and go on the same day.\n\nWe retreat there on Monday, and shall be there all the summer.\n\nMy small boy is perfectly happy at Southsea, and likes the school very\nmuch.

It is not a very pleasant or\ncheerful presentation of my daughters; but it is wonderfully like for\nall that, and in some details remarkably good. When I came home here\nyesterday I tried it in the large Townshend stereoscope, in which it\nshows to great advantage. It is in the little stereoscope at present on\nthe drawing-room table. One of the balustrades of the destroyed old\nRochester bridge has been (very nicely) presented to me by the\ncontractor for the works, and has been duly stonemasoned and set up on\nthe lawn behind the house. I have ordered a sun-dial for the top of it,\nand it will be a very good object indeed. The Plorn is highly excited\nto-day by reason of an institution which he tells me (after questioning\nGeorge) is called the \"Cobb, or Bodderin,\" holding a festival at The\nFalstaff. He is possessed of some vague information that they go to\nHigham Church, in pursuance of some old usage, and attend service there,\nand afterwards march round the village. It so far looks probable that\nthey certainly started off at eleven very spare in numbers, and came\nback considerably recruited, which looks to me like the difference\nbetween going to church and coming to dinner. They bore no end of bright\nbanners and broad sashes, and had a band with a terrific drum, and are\nnow (at half-past two) dining at The Falstaff, partly in the side room\non the ground-floor, and partly in a tent improvised this morning. The\ndrum is hung up to a tree in The Falstaff garden, and looks like a\ntropical sort of gourd. I have presented the band with five shillings,\nwhich munificence has been highly appreciated. Ices don't seem to be\nprovided for the ladies in the gallery--I mean the garden; they are\nprowling about there, endeavouring to peep in at the beef and mutton\nthrough the holes in the tent, on the whole, in a debased and degraded\nmanner.\n\nTurk somehow cut his foot in Cobham Lanes yesterday, and Linda hers.\nThey are both lame, and looking at each other. Fancy Mr. Townshend not\nintending to go for another three weeks, and designing to come down here\nfor a few days--with Henri and Bully--on Wednesday! I wish you could\nhave seen him alone with me on Saturday; he was so extraordinarily\nearnest and affectionate on my belongings and affairs in general, and\nnot least of all on you and Katie, that he cried in a most pathetic\nmanner, and was so affected that I was obliged to leave him among the\nflowerpots in the long passage at the end of the dining-room. It was a\nvery good piece of truthfulness and sincerity, especially in one of his\nyears, able to take life so easily.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wills are here now (but I daresay you know it from your\naunt), and return to town with me to-morrow morning. We are now going on\nto the castle. Mrs. Wills was very droll last night, and told me some\ngood stories. My dear, I wish particularly to impress upon you and dear\nKatie (to whom I send my other best love) that I hope your stay will not\nbe very long. I don't think it very good for either of you, though of\ncourse I know that Lotty will be, and must be, and should be the first\nconsideration with you both. I am very anxious to know how you found her\nand how you are yourself.\n\nBest love to dear Lotty and Mrs. White. The same to Mr. White and Clara.\nWe are always talking about you all.\n\n                        Ever, dearest Mamie, your affectionate Father.",

I followed the case with so much interest, and have followed\nthe miserable knaves and asses who have perverted it since, with so much\nindignation, that I have often had more than half a mind to write and\nthank the upright judge who tried him. I declare to God that I believe\nsuch a service one of the greatest that a man of intellect and courage\ncan render to society. Of course I saw the beast of a prisoner (with my\nmind's eye) delivering his cut-and-dried speech, and read in every word\nof it that no one but the murderer could have delivered or conceived\nit. Of course I have been driving the girls out of their wits here, by\nincessantly proclaiming that there needed no medical evidence either\nway, and that the case was plain without it. Lastly, of course (though a\nmerciful man--because a merciful man I mean), I would hang any Home\nSecretary (Whig, Tory, Radical, or otherwise) who should step in between\nthat black scoundrel and the gallows. I can_not_ believe--and my belief\nin all wrong as to public matters is enormous--that such a thing will be\ndone.\n\nI am reminded of Tennyson, by thinking that King Arthur would have made\nshort work of the amiable ----, whom the newspapers strangely delight to\nmake a sort of gentleman of. How fine the \"Idylls\" are! Lord! what a\nblessed thing it is to read a man who can write! I thought nothing could\nbe grander than the first poem till I came to the third; but when I had\nread the last, it seemed to be absolutely unapproached and\nunapproachable.\n\nTo come to myself. I have written and begged the \"All the Year Round\"\npublisher to send you directly four weeks' proofs beyond the current\nnumber, that are in type. I hope you will like them. Nothing but the\ninterest of the subject, and the pleasure of striving with the\ndifficulty of the forms of treatment, nothing in the mere way of money,\nI mean, could also repay the time and trouble of the incessant\ncondensation. But I set myself the little task of making a _picturesque_\nstory, rising in every chapter with characters true to nature, but whom\nthe story itself should express, more than they should express\nthemselves, by dialogue. I mean, in other words, that I fancied a story\nof incident might be written, in place of the bestiality that _is_\nwritten under that pretence, pounding the characters out in its own\nmortar, and beating their own interests out of them. If you could have\nread the story all at once, I hope you wouldn't have stopped halfway.\n\nAs to coming to your retreat, my dear Forster, think how helpless I am.\nI am not well yet. I have an instinctive feeling that nothing but the\nsea will restore me, and I am planning to go and work at Ballard's, at\nBroadstairs, from next Wednesday to Monday. I generally go to town on\nMonday afternoon. All Tuesday I am at the office, on Wednesday I come\nback here, and go to work again. I don't leave off till Monday comes\nround once more. I am fighting to get my story done by the first week in\nOctober. On the 10th of October I am going away to read for a fortnight\nat Ipswich, Norwich, Oxford, Cambridge, and a few other places. Judge\nwhat my spare time is just now!\n\nI am very much surprised and very sorry to find from the enclosed that\nElliotson has been ill. I never heard a word of it.\n\nGeorgy sends best love to you and to Mrs. Forster, so do I, so does\nPlorn, so does Frank. The girls are, for five days, with the Whites at\nRamsgate. It is raining, intensely hot, and stormy. Eighteen creatures,\nlike little tortoises, have dashed in at the window and fallen on the\npaper since I began this paragraph [Illustration: ink-blot] (that was\none!).

It came off in\nthe Assembly Room, now more exquisitely desolate than words can\ndescribe. Eighteen shillings was the \"take.\" Behind a screen among the\ncompany, we heard mysterious gurglings of water before the entertainment\nbegan, and then a slippery sound which occasioned me to whisper C. C.\n(who laughed in the most ridiculous manner), \"Soap.\" It proved to be the\nyoung lady washing herself. She must have been wonderfully dirty, for\nshe took a world of trouble, and didn't come out clean after all--in a\nwretched dirty muslin frock, with blue ribbons. She was the alleged\nmesmeriser, and a boy who distributed bills the alleged mesmerised. It\nwas a most preposterous imposition, but more ludicrous than any poor\nsight I ever saw. The boy is clearly out of pantomime, and when he\npretended to be in the mesmeric state, made the company back by going\nin among them head over heels, backwards, half-a-dozen times, in a most\ninsupportable way. The pianist had struck; and the manner in which the\nlecturer implored \"some lady\" to play a \"polker,\" and the manner in\nwhich no lady would; and in which the few ladies who were there sat with\ntheir hats on, and the elastic under their chins, as if it were going to\nblow, is never to be forgotten.

Therefore I altogether abandon and relinquish the\nidea. But I am just as heartily and cordially obliged to you for your\ninterest and friendship, as if the book had been turned into a play five\nhundred times. I again thank you ten thousand times, and am quite sure\nthat you are right. I only hope you will forgive my causing you so much\ntrouble, after your hard work.\n\nMy girls and Georgina send their kindest regards to Madame Regnier and\nto you.

There cannot be a\ndoubt that it is a very great advance on all your former writing, and\nmost especially in respect of tenderness. In character it is excellent.\nMr. Fairlie as good as the lawyer, and the lawyer as good as he.

But on turning to the book again, I find it\ndifficult to take out an instance of this. It rather belongs to your\nhabit of thought and manner of going about the work. Perhaps I express\nmy meaning best when I say that the three people who write the\nnarratives in these proofs have a DISSECTIVE property in common, which\nis essentially not theirs but yours; and that my own effort would be to\nstrike more of what is got _that way_ out of them by collision with one\nanother, and by the working of the story.\n\nYou know what an interest I have felt in your powers from the beginning\nof our friendship, and how very high I rate them? _I_ know that this is\nan admirable book, and that it grips the difficulties of the weekly\nportion and throws them in masterly style. No one else could do it half\nso well. I have stopped in every chapter to notice some instance of\ningenuity, or some happy turn of writing; and I am absolutely certain\nthat you never did half so well yourself.\n\nSo go on and prosper, and let me see some more, when you have enough\n(for your own satisfaction) to show me.

If\nClarendon had never written his \"History of the Rebellion,\" then I can\nunderstand that it might be. But just as it would be impossible to\nanswer an advocate who had misstated the merits of a case for his own\npurpose, without, in the interests of truth, and not of the other side\nmerely, re-stating the merits and showing them in their real form, so I\ncannot see the practicability of telling what you had to tell without\nin some sort championing the misrepresented side, and I think that you\ndon't do that as an advocate, but as a judge.\n\nThe evidence has been suppressed and coloured, and the judge goes\nthrough it and puts it straight. It is not _his_ fault if it all goes\none way and tends to one plain conclusion. Nor is it his fault that it\ngoes the further when it is laid out straight, or seems to do so,\nbecause it was so knotted and twisted up before.\n\nI can understand any man's, and particularly Carlyle's, having a\nlingering respect that does not like to be disturbed for those (in the\nbest sense of the word) loyal gentlemen of the country who went with the\nking and were so true to him. But I don't think Carlyle sufficiently\nconsiders that the great mass of those gentlemen _didn't know the\ntruth_, that it was a part of their loyalty to believe what they were\ntold on the king's behalf, and that it is reasonable to suppose that the\nking was too artful to make known to _them_ (especially after failure)\nwhat were very acceptable designs to the desperate soldiers of fortune\nabout Whitehall. And it was to me a curious point of adventitious\ninterest arising out of your book, to reflect on the probability of\ntheir having been as ignorant of the real scheme in Charles's head, as\ntheir descendants and followers down to this time, and to think with\npity and admiration that they believed the cause to be so much better\nthan it was. This is a notion I was anxious to have expressed in our\naccount of the book in these pages. For I don't suppose Clarendon, or\nany other such man to sit down and tell posterity something that he has\nnot \"tried on\" in his own time. Do you?\n\nIn the whole narrative I saw nothing anywhere to which I demurred. I\nadmired it all, went with it all, and was proud of my friend's having\nwritten it all. I felt it to be all square and sound and right, and to\nbe of enormous importance in these times. Firstly, to the people who\n(like myself) are so sick of the shortcomings of representative\ngovernment as to have no interest in it. Secondly, to the humbugs at\nWestminster who have come down--a long, long way--from those men, as you\nknow. When the great remonstrance came out, I was in the thick of my\nstory, and was always busy with it; but I am very glad I didn't read it\nthen, as I shall read it now to much better purpose. All the time I was\nat work on the \"Two Cities,\" I read no books but such as had the air of\nthe time in them.\n\nTo return for a final word to the Five Members. I thought the marginal\nreferences overdone. Here and there, they had a comical look to me for\nthat reason, and reminded me of shows and plays where everything is in\nthe bill.\n\nLastly, I should have written to you--as I had a strong inclination to\ndo, and ought to have done, immediately after reading the book--but for\na weak reason; of all things in the world I have lost heart in one--I\nhope no other--I cannot, times out of calculation, make up my mind to\nwrite a letter.\n\n                          Ever, my dear Forster, affectionately yours.",

My second daughter is\ngoing to be married in the course of the summer to Charles Collins, the\nbrother of Wilkie Collins, the novelist. The father was one of the most\nfamous painters of English green lanes and coast pieces. He was bred an\nartist; is a writer, too, and does \"The Eye Witness,\" in \"All the Year\nRound.\" He is a gentleman, accomplished, and amiable. My eldest daughter\nhas not yet started any conveyance on the road to matrimony (that I know\nof); but it is likely enough that she will, as she is very agreeable and\nintelligent. They are both very pretty. My eldest boy, Charley, has been\nin Barings' house for three or four years, and is now going to Hong\nKong, strongly backed up by Barings, to buy tea on his own account, as a\nmeans of forming a connection and seeing more of the practical part of a\nmerchant's calling, before starting in London for himself. His brother\nFrank (Jeffrey's godson) I have just recalled from France and Germany,\nto come and learn business, and qualify himself to join his brother on\nhis return from the Celestial Empire. The next boy, Sydney Smith, is\ndesigned for the navy, and is in training at Portsmouth, awaiting his\nnomination. He is about three foot high, with the biggest eyes ever\nseen, and is known in the Portsmouth parts as \"Young Dickens, who can do\neverything.\"\n\nAnother boy is at school in France; the youngest of all has a private\ntutor at home. I have forgotten the second in order, who is in India. He\nwent out as ensign of a non-existent native regiment, got attached to\nthe 42nd Highlanders, one of the finest regiments in the Queen's\nservice; has remained with them ever since, and got made a lieutenant by\nthe chances of the rebellious campaign, before he was eighteen. Miss\nHogarth, always Miss Hogarth, is the guide, philosopher, and friend of\nall the party, and a very close affection exists between her and the\ngirls. I doubt if she will ever marry. I don't know whether to be glad\nof it or sorry for it.\n\nI have laid down my pen and taken a long breath after writing this\nfamily history. I have also considered whether there are any more\nchildren, and I don't think there are. If I should remember two or three\nothers presently, I will mention them in a postscript.\n\nWe think Townshend looking a little the worse for the winter, and we\nperceive Bully to be decidedly old upon his legs, and of a most\ndiabolical turn of mind. When they first arrived the weather was very\ndark and cold, and kept them indoors. It has since turned very warm and\nbright, but with a dusty and sharp east wind. They are still kept\nindoors by this change, and I begin to wonder what change will let them\nout. Townshend dines with us every Sunday. You may be sure that we\nalways talk of you and yours, and drink to you heartily.\n\nPublic matters here are thought to be rather improving; the deep\nmistrust of the gentleman in Paris being counteracted by the vigorous\nstate of preparation into which the nation is getting. You will have\nobserved, of course, that we establish a new defaulter in respect of\nsome great trust, about once a quarter. The last one, the cashier of a\nCity bank, is considered to have distinguished himself greatly, a\nquarter of a million of money being high game.\n\nNo, my friend, I have not shouldered my rifle yet, but I should do so on\nmore pressing occasion. Every other man in the row of men I know--if\nthey were all put in a row--is a volunteer though. There is a tendency\nrather to overdo the wearing of the uniform, but that is natural enough\nin the case of the youngest men. The turn-out is generally very\ncreditable indeed. At the ball they had (in a perfectly unventilated\nbuilding), their new leather belts and pouches smelt so fearfully that\nit was, as my eldest daughter said, like shoemaking in a great prison.\nShe, consequently, distinguished herself by fainting away in the most\ninaccessible place in the whole structure, and being brought out\n(horizontally) by a file of volunteers, like some slain daughter of\nAlbion whom they were carrying into the street to rouse the indignant\nvalour of the populace.\n\nLord, my dear Cerjat, when I turn to that page of your letter where you\nwrite like an ancient sage in whom the fire has paled into a meek-eyed\nstate of coolness and virtue, I half laugh and half cry! _You_ old!\n_You_ a sort of hermit? Boh! Get out.\n\nWith this comes my love and all our loves, to you and Mrs. Cerjat, and\nyour daughter. I add my special and particular to the sweet \"singing\ncousin.\" When shall you and I meet, and where? Must I come to see\nTownshend? I begin to think so.\n\n                 Ever, my dear Cerjat, your affectionate and faithful.",

And surely when the new philosophy was the talk\nof the salons and the slang of the hour, it is not unreasonable or\nunallowable to suppose a nobleman wedded to the old cruel ideas, and\nrepresenting the time going out, as his nephew represents the time\ncoming in; as to the condition of the peasant in France generally at\nthat day, I take it that if anything be certain on earth it is certain\nthat it was intolerable. No _ex post facto_ enquiries and provings by\nfigures will hold water, surely, against the tremendous testimony of men\nliving at the time.\n\nThere is a curious book printed at Amsterdam, written to make out no\ncase whatever, and tiresome enough in its literal dictionary-like\nminuteness, scattered up and down the pages of which is full authority\nfor my marquis. This is \"Mercier's Tableau de Paris.\" Rousseau is the\nauthority for the peasant's shutting up his house when he had a bit of\nmeat. The tax-taker was the authority for the wretched creature's\nimpoverishment.\n\nI am not clear, and I never have been clear, respecting that canon of\nfiction which forbids the interposition of accident in such a case as\nMadame Defarge's death. Where the accident is inseparable from the\npassion and emotion of the character, where it is strictly consistent\nwith the whole design, and arises out of some culminating proceeding on\nthe part of the character which the whole story has led up to, it seems\nto me to become, as it were, an act of divine justice. And when I use\nMiss Pross (though this is quite another question) to bring about that\ncatastrophe, I have the positive intention of making that half-comic\nintervention a part of the desperate woman's failure, and of opposing\nthat mean death--instead of a desperate one in the streets, which she\nwouldn't have minded--to the dignity of Carton's wrong or right; this\n_was_ the design, and seemed to be in the fitness of things.\n\nNow, as to the reading. I am sorry to say that it is out of the question\nthis season. I have had an attack of rheumatism--quite a stranger to\nme--which remains hovering about my left side, after having doubled me\nup in the back, and which would disable me from standing for two hours.\nI have given up all dinners and town engagements, and come to my little\nFalstaff House here, sensible of the necessity of country training all\nthrough the summer. Smith would have proposed any appointment to see you\non the subject, but he has been dreadfully ill with tic. Whenever I read\nin London, I will gladly put a night aside for your purpose, and we will\nplot to connect your name with it, and give it some speciality. But this\ncould not be before Christmas time, as I should not be able to read\nsooner, for in the hot weather it would be useless. Let me hear from you\nabout this when you have considered it. It would greatly diminish the\nexpenses, remember.\n\n                                   Ever affectionately and faithfully.",

Without any figure of\nspeech it turned one white and sick to behold them.\n\nTavistock House is cleared to-day, and possession delivered up. I must\nsay that in all things the purchaser has behaved thoroughly well, and\nthat I cannot call to mind any occasion when I have had money dealings\nwith a Christian that have been so satisfactory, considerate, and\ntrusting.\n\nI am ornamented at present with one of my most intensely preposterous\nand utterly indescribable colds. If you were to make a voyage from Cape\nHorn to Wellington Street, you would scarcely recognise in the bowed\nform, weeping eyes, rasped nose, and snivelling wretch whom you would\nencounter here, the once gay and sparkling, etc. etc.\n\nEverything else here is as quiet as possible. Business reports you\nreceive from Holsworth. Wilkie looked in to-day, going to\nGloucestershire for a week. The office is full of discarded curtains and\ncoverings from Tavistock House, which Georgina is coming up this evening\nto select from and banish. Mary is in raptures with the beauties of\nDunkeld, but is not very well in health. The Admiral (Sydney) goes up\nfor his examination to-morrow. If he fails to pass with credit, I will\nnever believe in anybody again, so in that case look out for your own\nreputation with me.\n\nThis is really all the news I have, except that I am lazy, and that\nWilkie dines here next Tuesday, in order that we may have a talk about\nthe Christmas number.\n\nI beg to send my kind regard to Mrs. Wills, and to enquire how she likes\nwearing a hat, which of course she does. I also want to know from her\nin confidence whether _Crwllm festidiniog llymthll y wodd_?\n\nYesterday I burnt, in the field at Gad's Hill, the accumulated letters\nand papers of twenty years.

WATSON,\n\nI lose no time in answering your letter; and first as to business, the\nschool in the High Town at Boulogne was excellent. The boys all English,\nthe two proprietors an old Eton master and one of the Protestant\nclergymen of the town. The teaching unusually sound and good. The manner\nand conduct developed in the boys quite admirable. But I have never\nseen a gentleman so perfectly acquainted with boy-nature as the Eton\nmaster. There was a perfect understanding between him and his charges;\nnothing pedantic on his part, nothing slavish on their parts. The result\nwas, that either with him or away from him, the boys combined an ease\nand frankness with a modesty and sense of responsibility that was really\nabove all praise. Alfred went from there to a great school at Wimbledon,\nwhere they train for India and the artillery and engineers. Sydney went\nfrom there to Mr. Barrow, at Southsea. In both instances the new masters\nwrote to me of their own accord, bearing quite unsolicited testimony to\nthe merits of the old, and expressing their high recognition of what\nthey had done. These things speak for themselves.\n\nSydney has just passed his examination as a naval cadet and come home,\nall eyes and gold buttons. He has twelve days' leave before going on\nboard the training-ship. Katie and her husband are in France, and seem\nlikely to remain there for an indefinite period. Mary is on a month's\nvisit in Scotland; Georgina, Frank, and Plorn are at home here; and we\nall want Mary and her little dog back again. I have sold Tavistock\nHouse, am making this rather complete in its way, and am on the restless\neve of beginning a new big book; but mean to have a furnished house in\ntown (in some accessible quarter) from February or so to June. May we\nmeet there.\n\nYour handwriting is always so full of pleasant memories to me, that when\nI took it out of the post-office at Rochester this afternoon it quite\nstirred my heart. But we must not think of old times as sad times, or\nregard them as anything but the fathers and mothers of the present. We\nmust all climb steadily up the mountain after the talking bird, the\nsinging tree, and the yellow water, and must all bear in mind that the\nprevious climbers who were scared into looking back got turned into\nblack stone.\n\nMary Boyle was here a little while ago, as affectionate at heart as\never, as young, and as pleasant. Of course we talked often of you. So\nlet me know when you are established in Halfmoon Street, and I shall be\ntruly delighted to come and see you.\n\nFor my attachments are strong attachments and never weaken. In right of\nbygones, I feel as if \"all Northamptonshire\" belonged to me, as all\nNorthumberland did to Lord Bateman in the ballad. In memory of your\nwarming your feet at the fire in that waste of a waiting-room when I\nread at Brighton, I have ever since taken that watering-place to my\nbosom as I never did before. And you and Switzerland are always one to\nme, and always inseparable.\n\nCharley was heard of yesterday, from Shanghai, going to Japan, intending\nto meet his brother Walter at Calcutta, and having an idea of beguiling\nthe time between whiles by asking to be taken as an amateur with the\nEnglish Chinese forces.

We went down\ntogether, and the boys were in the closest alliance. Bromley being\nAccountant-General of the Navy, and having influence on board, got their\nhammocks changed so that they would be serving side by side, at which\nthey were greatly pleased. The moment we stepped on board, the \"Hul-lo!\nhere's Dickens!\" was repeated on all sides, and the Admiral (evidently\nhighly popular) shook hands with about fifty of his messmates. Taking\nBromley for my model (with whom I fraternised in the most pathetic\nmanner), I gave Sydney a sovereign before stepping over the side. He was\nas little overcome as it was possible for a boy to be, and stood waving\nthe gold-banded cap as we came ashore in a boat.\n\nThere is no denying that he looks very small aboard a great ship, and\nthat a boy must have a strong and decided speciality for the sea to take\nto such a life. Captain Harris was not on board, but the other chief\nofficers were, and were highly obliging. We went over the ship. I should\nsay that there can be little or no individuality of address to any\nparticular boy, but that they all tumble through their education in a\ncrowded way. The Admiral's servant (I mean our Admiral's) had an idiotic\nappearance, but perhaps it did him injustice (a mahogany-faced marine by\nstation).

I will tell you why.\n\nLast week, I got to work on a new story. I called a council of war at\nthe office on Tuesday. It was perfectly clear that the one thing to be\ndone was, for me to strike in. I have therefore decided to begin a\nstory, the length of the \"Tale of Two Cities,\" on the 1st of\nDecember--begin publishing, that is. I must make the most I can out of\nthe book. When I come down, I will bring you the first two or three\nweekly parts. The name is, \"GREAT EXPECTATIONS.\" I think a good name?\n\nNow the preparations to get ahead, combined with the absolute necessity\nof my giving a good deal of time to the Christmas number, will tie me to\nthe grindstone pretty tightly. It will be just as much as I can hope to\ndo. Therefore, what I had hoped would be a few days at Eastbourne\ndiminish to a few hours.\n\nI took the Admiral down to Portsmouth. Every maritime person in the town\nknew him. He seemed to know every boy on board the _Britannia_, and was\na tremendous favourite evidently. It was very characteristic of him that\nthey good-naturedly helped him, he being so very small, into his hammock\nat night. But he couldn't rest in it on these terms, and got out again\nto learn the right way of getting in independently. Official report\nstated that \"after a few spills, he succeeded perfectly, and went to\nsleep.\" He is perfectly happy on board, takes tea with the captain,\nleads choruses on Saturday nights, and has an immense marine for a\nservant.\n\nI saw Edmund Yates at the office, and he told me that during all his\nmother's wanderings of mind, which were almost incessant at last, she\nnever once went back to the old Adelphi days until she was just dying,\nwhen he heard her say, in great perplexity: \"I can _not_ get the words.\"\n\nBest love to Mrs. Forster.\n\n                                Ever, my dear Forster, affectionately.",

I also found a letter from\nGeorgina, describing that Mary's horse went down suddenly on a stone,\nand how Mary was thrown, and had her riding-habit torn to pieces, and\nhas a deep cut just above the knee--fortunately not in the knee itself,\nwhich is doing exceedingly well, but which will probably incapacitate\nher from walking for days and days to come. It is well it was no worse.\nThe accident occurred at Milton, near Gravesend, and they found Mary in\na public-house there, wonderfully taken care of and looked after.\n\nI propose that we start on Thursday morning, the 1st of November. The\ntrain for Penzance leaves the Great Western terminus at a quarter-past\nnine in the morning. It is a twelve hours' journey. Shall we meet at the\nterminus at nine? I shall be here all the previous day, and shall dine\nhere.\n\nYour account of your passage goes to my heart through my stomach. What a\npity I was not there on board to present that green-visaged, but\nsweet-tempered and uncomplaining spectacle of imbecility, at which I am\nso expert under stormy circumstances, in the poet's phrase:\n\n        As I sweep\n        Through the deep,\n        When the stormy winds do blow.\n\nWhat a pity I am not there, at Meurice's, to sleep the sleep of infancy\nthrough the long plays where the gentlemen stand with their backs to the\nmantelpieces. What a pity I am not with you to make a third at the Trois\nFr\u00e8res, and drink no end of bottles of Bordeaux, without ever getting a\ntouch of redness in my (poet's phrase again) \"innocent nose.\" But I must\ngo down to Gad's to-night, and get to work again. Four weekly numbers\nhave been ground off the wheel, and at least another must be turned\nbefore we meet. They shall be yours in the slumberous railway-carriage.\n\nI don't think Forster is at all in good health. He was tremendously\nhospitable and hearty. I walked six hours and a half on the downs\nyesterday, and never stopped or sat. Early in the morning, before\nbreakfast, I went to the nearest baths to get a shower-bath. They kept\nme waiting longer than I thought reasonable, and seeing a man in a cap\nin the passage, I went to him and said: \"I really must request that\nyou'll be good enough to see about this shower-bath;\" and it was Hullah!\nwaiting for another bath.\n\nRumours were brought into the house on Saturday night, that there was a\n\"ghost\" up at Larkins's monument. Plorn was frightened to death, and I\nwas apprehensive of the ghost's spreading and coming there, and causing\n\"warning\" and desertion among the servants. Frank was at home, and\nAndrew Gordon was with us. Time, nine o'clock. Village talk and\ncredulity, amazing. I armed the two boys with a short stick apiece, and\nshouldered my double-barrelled gun, well loaded with shot. \"Now\nobserve,\" says I to the domestics, \"if anybody is playing tricks and has\ngot a head, I'll blow it off.\" Immense impression. New groom evidently\nconvinced that he has entered the service of a bloodthirsty demon. We\nascend to the monument. Stop at the gate. Moon is rising. Heavy shadows.\n\"Now, look out!\" (from the bloodthirsty demon, in a loud, distinct\nvoice). \"If the ghost is here and I see him, so help me God I'll fire at\nhim!\" Suddenly, as we enter the field, a most extraordinary noise\nresponds--terrific noise--human noise--and yet superhuman noise. B. T.\nD. brings piece to shoulder. \"Did you hear that, pa?\" says Frank. \"I\ndid,\" says I. Noise repeated--portentous, derisive, dull, dismal,\ndamnable. We advance towards the sound. Something white comes lumbering\nthrough the darkness. An asthmatic sheep! Dead, as I judge, by this\ntime. Leaving Frank to guard him, I took Andrew with me, and went all\nround the monument, and down into the ditch, and examined the field\nwell, thinking it likely that somebody might be taking advantage of the\nsheep to frighten the village. Drama ends with discovery of no one, and\ntriumphant return to rum-and-water.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

Besides which, it is a cigar-case, and will\nhold cigars; two crowning merits that I never yet knew to be possessed\nby any article claiming the same name. For all of these reasons, but\nmore than all because it comes from you, I love it, and send you\neighteen hundred and sixty kisses, with one in for the new year.\n\nBoth excellent stories and perfectly new. Your Joe swears that he never\nheard either--never a word or syllable of either--after he laughed at\n'em this blessed day.\n\nI have no news, except that I am not quite well, and am being doctored.\nPray read \"Great Expectations.\" I think it is very droll. It is a very\ngreat success, and seems universally liked. I suppose because it opens\nfunnily, and with an interest too.\n\nI pass my time here (I am staying here alone) in working, taking physic,\nand taking a stall at a theatre every night. On Boxing Night I was at\nCovent Garden. A dull pantomime was \"worked\" (as we say) better than I\never saw a heavy piece worked on a first night, until suddenly and\nwithout a moment's warning, every scene on that immense stage fell over\non its face, and disclosed chaos by gaslight behind! There never was\nsuch a business; about sixty people who were on the stage being\nextinguished in the most remarkable manner. Not a soul was hurt. In the\nuproar, some moon-calf rescued a porter pot, six feet high (out of which\nthe clown had been drinking when the accident happened), and stood it on\nthe cushion of the lowest proscenium box, P.S., beside a lady and\ngentleman, who were dreadfully ashamed of it. The moment the house knew\nthat nobody was injured, they directed their whole attention to this\ngigantic porter pot in its genteel position (the lady and gentleman\ntrying to hide behind it), and roared with laughter. When a modest\nfootman came from behind the curtain to clear it, and took it up in his\narms like a Brobdingnagian baby, we all laughed more than ever we had\nlaughed in our lives. I don't know why.\n\nWe have had a fire here, but our people put it out before the\nparish-engine arrived, like a drivelling perambulator, with _the beadle\nin it_, like an imbecile baby. Popular opinion, disappointed in the fire\nhaving been put out, snowballed the beadle. God bless it!\n\nOver the way at the Lyceum, there is a very fair Christmas piece, with\none or two uncommonly well-done nigger songs--one remarkably gay and\nmad, done in the finale to a scene. Also a very nice transformation,\nthough I don't know what it means.\n\nThe poor actors waylay me in Bow Street, to represent their necessities;\nand I often see one cut down a court when he beholds me coming, cut\nround Drury Lane to face me, and come up towards me near this door in\nthe freshest and most accidental way, as if I was the last person he\nexpected to see on the surface of this globe. The other day, there thus\nappeared before me (simultaneously with a scent of rum in the air) one\naged and greasy man, with a pair of pumps under his arm. He said he\nthought if he could get down to somewhere (I think it was Newcastle), he\nwould get \"taken on\" as Pantaloon, the existing Pantaloon being \"a\nstick, sir--a mere muff.\" I observed that I was sorry times were so bad\nwith him. \"Mr. Dickens, you know our profession, sir--no one knows it\nbetter, sir--there is no right feeling in it. I was Harlequin on your\nown circuit, sir, for five-and-thirty years, and was displaced by a boy,\nsir!--a boy!\"\n\nSo no more at present, except love to Mrs. Watson and Bedgey Prig and\nall, from my dear Mary.\n\n                                              Your ever affectionate\n                                                                  JOE.\n\nP.S.--DON'T I pine neither?\n\nP.P.S.--I did my best to arouse Forster's worst feelings; but he had got\ninto a Christmas habit of mind, and wouldn't respond.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[6] With whom Mr. and Mrs. Wills were staying at Aberystwith.",

At Gad's Hill it\nwas so intensely cold, that in our warm dining-room on Christmas Day we\ncould hardly sit at the table. In my study on that morning, long after a\ngreat fire of coal and wood had been lighted, the thermometer was I\ndon't know where below freezing. The bath froze, and all the pipes\nfroze, and remained in a stony state for five or six weeks. The water in\nthe bedroom-jugs froze, and blew up the crockery. The snow on the top of\nthe house froze, and was imperfectly removed with axes. My beard froze\nas I walked about, and I couldn't detach my cravat and coat from it\nuntil I was thawed at the fire. My boys and half the officers stationed\nat Chatham skated away without a check to Gravesend--five miles off--and\nrepeated the performance for three or four weeks. At last the thaw came,\nand then everything split, blew up, dripped, poured, perspired, and got\nspoilt. Since then we have had a small visitation of the plague of\nservants; the cook (in a riding-habit) and the groom (in a dress-coat\nand jewels) having mounted Mary's horse and mine, in our absence, and\nscoured the neighbouring country at a rattling pace. And when I went\nhome last Saturday, I innocently wondered how the horses came to be out\nof condition, and gravely consulted the said groom on the subject, who\ngave it as his opinion \"which they wanted reg'lar work.\" We are now\ncoming to town until midsummer. Having sold my own house, to be more\nfree and independent, I have taken a very pretty furnished house, No. 3,\nHanover Terrace, Regent's Park. This, of course, on my daughter's\naccount. For I have very good and cheerful bachelor rooms here, with an\nold servant in charge, who is the cleverest man of his kind in the\nworld, and can do anything, from excellent carpentery to excellent\ncookery, and has been with me three-and-twenty years.\n\nThe American business is the greatest English sensation at present. I\nventure to predict that the struggle of violence will be a very short\none, and will be soon succeeded by some new compact between the Northern\nand Southern States. Meantime the Lancashire mill-owners are getting\nvery uneasy.\n\nThe Italian state of things is not regarded as looking very cheerful.\nWhat from one's natural sympathies with a people so oppressed as the\nItalians, and one's natural antagonism to a pope and a Bourbon (both of\nwhich superstitions I do suppose the world to have had more than enough\nof), I agree with you concerning Victor Emmanuel, and greatly fear that\nthe Southern Italians are much degraded. Still, an united Italy would be\nof vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in\nLouis Napoleon's way, as he very well knows. Therefore the idea must be\nchampioned, however much against hope.\n\nMy eldest boy, just home from China, was descried by Townshend's Henri\nthe moment he landed at Marseilles, and was by him borne in triumph to\nTownshend's rooms. The weather was snowy, slushy, beastly; and\nMarseilles was, as it usually is to my thinking, well-nigh intolerable.\nMy boy could not stay with Townshend, as he was coming on by express\ntrain; but he says: \"I sat with him and saw him dine. He had a leg of\nlamb, and a tremendous cold.\" That is the whole description I have been\nable to extract from him.\n\nThis journal is doing gloriously, and \"Great Expectations\" is a great\nsuccess. I have taken my third boy, Frank (Jeffrey's godson), into this\noffice. If I am not mistaken, he has a natural literary taste and\ncapacity, and may do very well with a chance so congenial to his mind,\nand being also entered at the Bar.\n\nDear me, when I have to show you about London, and we dine _en gar\u00e7on_\nat odd places, I shall scarcely know where to begin. Only yesterday I\nwalked out from here in the afternoon, and thought I would go down by\nthe Houses of Parliament. When I got there, the day was so beautifully\nbright and warm, that I thought I would walk on by Millbank, to see the\nriver. I walked straight on _for three miles_ on a splendid broad\nesplanade overhanging the Thames, with immense factories, railway works,\nand what-not erected on it, and with the strangest beginnings and ends\nof wealthy streets pushing themselves into the very Thames. When I was a\nrower on that river, it was all broken ground and ditch, with here and\nthere a public-house or two, an old mill, and a tall chimney. I had\nnever seen it in any state of transition, though I suppose myself to\nknow this rather large city as well as anyone in it.",

I have not seen, and\ndon't intend to see, the Hero of Niagara (as the posters call him), but\nI have been beguiled into seeing L\u00e9otard, and it is at once the most\nfearful and most graceful thing I have ever seen done.\n\nClara White (grown pretty) has been staying with us.\n\nI am sore afraid that _The Times_, by playing fast and loose with the\nAmerican question, has very seriously compromised this country. The\nAmericans northward are perfectly furious on the subject; and Motley the\nhistorian (a very sensible man, strongly English in his sympathies)\nassured me the other day that he thought the harm done very serious\nindeed, and the dangerous nature of the daily widening breach scarcely\ncalculable.\n\nKindest and best love to all.

You shall have it when you come back to town. I have put in a\nvery pretty piece of writing, and I have no doubt the story will be more\nacceptable through the alteration.\n\nI have not seen Bulwer's changed story. I brought back the first month\nwith me, and I know the nature of his changes throughout; but I have not\nyet had the revised proofs. He was in a better state at Knebworth than I\nhave ever seen him in all these years, a little weird occasionally\nregarding magic and spirits, but perfectly fair and frank under\nopposition. He was talkative, anecdotical, and droll; looked young and\nwell, laughed heartily, and enjoyed some games we played with great\nzest. In his artist character and talk he was full of interest and\nmatter, but that he always is. Socially, he seemed to me almost a new\nman. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and so did Georgina and Mary.\n\nThe fire I did not see until the Monday morning, but it was blazing\nfiercely then, and was blazing hardly less furiously when I came down\nhere again last Friday. I was here on the night of its breaking out. If\nI had been in London I should have been on the scene, pretty surely.\n\nYou will be perhaps surprised to hear that it is Morgan's conviction\n(his son was here yesterday), that the North will put down the South,\nand that speedily. In his management of his large business, he is\nproceeding steadily on that conviction. He says that the South has no\nmoney and no credit, and that it is impossible for it to make a\nsuccessful stand. He may be all wrong, but he is certainly a very shrewd\nman, and he has never been, as to the United States, an enthusiast of\nany class.\n\nPoor Lord Campbell's seems to me as easy and good a death as one could\ndesire. There must be a sweep of these men very soon, and one feels as\nif it must fall out like the breaking of an arch--one stone goes from a\nprominent place, and then the rest begin to drop. So one looks towards\nBrougham, and Lyndhurst, and Pollock.\n\nI will add no more to this, or I know I shall not send it; for I am in\nthe first desperate laziness of having done my book, and think of\noffering myself to the village school as a live example of that vice for\nthe edification of youth.\n\n                                Ever, my dear Forster, affectionately.",

WATSON,\n\nI have owed you a letter for so long a time that I fear you may\nsometimes have misconstrued my silence. But I hope that the sight of the\nhandwriting of your old friend will undeceive you, if you have, and will\nput that right.\n\nDuring the progress of my last story, I have been working so hard that\nvery, very little correspondence--except enforced correspondence on\nbusiness--has passed this pen. And now that I am free again, I devote a\nfew of my first leisure moments to this note.\n\nYou seemed in your last to think that I had forgotten you in respect of\nthe Christmas number. Not so at all. I discussed with them here where\nyou were, how you were to be addressed, and the like; finally left the\nnumber in a blank envelope, and did not add the address to it until it\nwould have been absurd to send you such stale bread. This was my fault,\nbut this was all. And I should be so pained at heart if you supposed me\ncapable of failing in my truth and cordiality, or in the warm\nremembrance of the time we have passed together, that perhaps I make\nmore of it than you meant to do.\n\nMy sailor-boy is at home--I was going to write, for the holidays, but I\nsuppose I must substitute \"on leave.\" Under the new regulations, he must\nnot pass out of the _Britannia_ before December. The younger boys are\nall at school, and coming home this week for the holidays. Mary keeps\nhouse, of course, and Katie and her husband surprised us yesterday, and\nare here now. Charley is holiday-making at Guernsey and Jersey. He has\nbeen for some time seeking a partnership in business, and has not yet\nfound one. The matter is in the hands of Mr. Bates, the managing partner\nin Barings' house, and seems as slow a matter to adjust itself as ever I\nlooked on at. Georgina is, as usual, the general friend and confidante\nand factotum of the whole party.\n\nYour present correspondent read at St. James's Hall in the beginning of\nthe season, to perfectly astounding audiences; but finding that fatigue\nand excitement very difficult to manage in conjunction with a story,\ndeemed it prudent to leave off reading in high tide and mid-career, the\nrather by reason of something like neuralgia in the face. At the end of\nOctober I begin again; and if you are at Brighton in November, I shall\ntry to see you there. I deliver myself up to Mr. Arthur Smith, and I\nknow it is one of the places for which he has put me down.\n\nThis is all about me and mine, and next I want to know why you never\ncome to Gad's Hill, and whether you are never coming. The stress I lay\non these questions you will infer from the size of the following note of\ninterrogation[HW: =?=]\n\nI am in the constant receipt of news from Lausanne. Of Mary Boyle, I\ndaresay you have seen and heard more than I have lately. Rumours\noccasionally reach me of her acting in every English shire incessantly,\nand getting in a harvest of laurels all the year round. Cavendish I have\nnot seen for a long time, but when I did see him last, it was at\nTavistock House, and we dined together jovially. Mention of that\nlocality reminds me that when you DO come here, you will see the\npictures looking wonderfully better, and more precious than they ever\ndid in town. Brought together in country light and air, they really are\nquite a baby collection and very pretty.\n\nI direct this to Rockingham, supposing you to be there in this summer\ntime. If you are as leafy in Northamptonshire as we are in Kent, you are\ngreener than you have been for some years. I hope you may have seen a\nlarge-headed photograph with little legs, representing the undersigned,\npen in hand, tapping his forehead to knock an idea out. It has just\nsprung up so abundantly in all the shops, that I am ashamed to go about\ntown looking in at the picture-windows, which is my delight. It seems to\nme extraordinarily ludicrous, and much more like than the grave portrait\ndone in earnest. It made me laugh when I first came upon it, until I\nshook again, in open sunlighted Piccadilly.\n\nPray be a good Christian to me, and don't be retributive in measuring\nout the time that shall pass before you write to me. And believe me\never,\n\n                                       Your affectionate and faithful.",

It will now and then unfortunately happen when\nthe place of reading is small (as in this case), that some confusion\nand inconvenience arise from the local agents over-estimating, in\nperfect good faith and sincerity, the capacity of the room. Such a\nmistake, I am assured, was made last night; and thus all the available\nspace was filled before the people in charge were at all prepared for\nthat circumstance.\n\nYou may readily suppose that I can have no personal knowledge of the\nproceedings of the people in my employment at such a time. But I wish to\nassure you very earnestly, that they are all old servants, well\nacquainted with my principles and wishes, and that they are under the\nstrongest injunction to avoid any approach to mercenary dealing; and to\nbehave to all comers equally with as much consideration and politeness\nas they know I should myself display. The recent death of a\nmuch-regretted friend of mine, who managed this business for me, and on\nwhom these men were accustomed to rely in any little difficulty, caused\nthem (I have no doubt) to feel rather at a loss in your case. Do me the\nfavour to understand that under any other circumstances you would, as a\nmatter of course, have been provided with any places whatever that could\nbe found, without the smallest reference to what you had originally\npaid. This is scanty satisfaction to you, but it is so strictly the\ntruth, that yours is the first complaint of the kind I have ever\nreceived.\n\nI hope to read in Dover again, but it is quite impossible that I can\nmake any present arrangement for that purpose. Whenever I may return\nhere, you may be sure I shall not fail to remember that I owe you a\nrecompense for a disappointment. In the meanwhile I very sincerely\nregret it.\n\n                                                     Faithfully yours.",

All the great side of The Lord\nWarden next the sea had to be emptied, the break of the sea was so\nprodigious, and the noise was so utterly confounding. The sea came in\nlike a great sky of immense clouds, for ever breaking suddenly into\nfurious rain. All kinds of wreck were washed in. Miss Birmingham and I\nsaw, among other things, a very pretty brass-bound chest being thrown\nabout like a feather. On Tuesday night, the unhappy Ostend packet could\nnot get in, neither could she go back, and she beat about the Channel\nuntil noon yesterday. I saw her come in then, _with five men at the\nwheel_; such a picture of misery, as to the crew (of passengers there\nwere no signs), as you can scarcely imagine.\n\nTho effect at Hastings and at Dover really seems to have outdone the\nbest usual impression, and at Dover they wouldn't go, but sat applauding\nlike mad. The most delicate audience I have seen in any provincial place\nis Canterbury. The audience with the greatest sense of humour certainly\nis Dover. The people in the stalls set the example of laughing, in the\nmost curiously unreserved way; and they really laughed when Squeers read\nthe boys' letters, with such cordial enjoyment, that the contagion\nextended to me, for one couldn't hear them without laughing too.\n\nSo, thank God, all goes well, and the recompense for the trouble is in\nevery way great. There is rather an alarming breakdown at Newcastle, in\nrespect of all the bills having been, in some inscrutable way, lost on\nthe road. I have resolved to send Berry there, with full powers to do\nall manner of things, early next week.\n\nThe amended route-list is not printed yet, because I am trying to get\noff Manchester and Liverpool; both of which I strongly doubt, in the\npresent state of American affairs. Therefore I can't send it for\nMarguerite; but I can, and do, send her my love and God-speed. This is\naddressed to the office because I suppose you will be there to-morrow.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

The consequence has been that the agent could\nnot announce all through the \"Jenny Lind\" time (the most important for\nannouncing), and could but stand still and stare when people came to ask\nwhat I was going to read. Last night I read \"Copperfield\" to the most\nenthusiastic and appreciative audience imaginable, but in numbers about\nhalf what they might have been. To-night we shall have a famous house;\nbut we might have had it last night too. To-morrow (knowing by this time\nwhat can, of a certainty, be done with \"Copperfield\"), I had, of course,\ngiven out \"Copperfield\" to be read again. Conceive my amazement and\ndismay when I find the printer to have announced \"Little Dombey\"!!!\nThis, I declare, I had no more intention of reading than I had of\nreading an account of the solar system. And this, after a sensation last\nnight, of a really extraordinary nature in its intensity and delight!\n\nSays the unlucky Headland to this first head of misery: \"Johnson's\nmistake\" (Johnson being the printer).\n\nSecond, I read at Edinburgh for the first time--observe the day--_next\nWednesday_. Jenny Lind's concert at Edinburgh is to-night. This morning\ncomes a frantic letter from the Edinburgh agent. \"I have no bills, no\ntickets; I lose all the announcement I would have made to hundreds upon\nhundreds of people to-night, all of the most desirable class to be well\ninformed beforehand. I can't announce what Mr. Dickens is going to read;\nI can answer no question; I have, upon my responsibility, put a dreary\nadvertisement into the papers announcing that he _is_ going to read so\nmany times, and that particulars will shortly be ready; and I stand\nbound hand and foot.\" \"Johnson's mistake,\" says the unlucky Headland.\n\nOf course, I know that the man who never made a mistake in poor Arthur's\ntime is not likely to be always making mistakes now. But I have written\nby this post to Wills, to go to him and investigate. I have also\ndetached Berry from here, and have sent him on by train at a few\nminutes' notice to Edinburgh, and then to Glasgow (where I have no doubt\neverything is wrong too). Glasgow we may save; Edinburgh I hold to be\nirretrievably damaged. If it can be picked up at all, it can only be at\nthe loss of the two first nights, and by the expenditure of no end of\nspirits and force. And this is the harder, because it is impossible not\nto see that the last readings polished and prepared the audiences in\ngeneral, and that I have not to work them up in any place where I have\nbeen before, but that they start with a London intelligence, and with a\nrespect and preparation for what they are going to hear.\n\nI hope by the time you and Mamie come to me, we shall have got into some\ngood method. I must take the thing more into my own hands and look after\nit from hour to hour. If such a thing as this Edinburgh business could\nhave happened under poor Arthur, I really believe he would have fallen\ninto a fit, or gone distracted. No one can ever know what he was but I\nwho have been with him and without him. Headland is so anxious and so\ngood-tempered that I cannot be very stormy with him; but it is the\nsimple fact that he has no notion of the requirements of such work as\nthis. Without him, and with a larger salary to Berry (though there are\nobjections to the latter as _first_ man), I could have done a hundred\ntimes better.\n\nAs Forster will have a strong interest in knowing all about the\nproceedings, perhaps you will send him this letter to read. There is no\nvery tremendous harm, indeed, done as yet. At Edinburgh I KNOW what I\ncan do with \"Copperfield.\" I think it is not too much to say that for\nevery one who does come to hear it on the first night, I can get back\nfifty on the second. And whatever can be worked up there will tell on\nGlasgow. Berry I shall continue to send on ahead, and I shall take\nnothing on trust and more as being done.\n\nOn Sunday morning at six, I have to start for Berwick. From Berwick, in\nthe course of that day, I will write again; to Mamie next time.\n\nWith best love to her and Mrs. B.",

An immense Corn Exchange made of glass and iron, round,\ndome-topped, lofty, utterly absurd for any such purpose, and full of\nthundering echoes, with a little lofty crow's-nest of a stone gallery\nbreast high, deep in the wall, into which it was designed to put _me_!

I got them to lie down upon it, and it was like some impossible\ntableau or gigantic picnic; one pretty girl in full dress lying on her\nside all night, holding on to one of the legs of my table. It was the\nmost extraordinary sight. And yet from the moment I began to the moment\nof my leaving off, they never missed a point, and they ended with a\nburst of cheers.\n\nThe confusion was decidedly owing to the local agents. But I think it\nmay have been a little heightened by Headland's way of sending them the\ntickets to sell in the first instance.\n\nNow, as I must read again in Edinburgh on Saturday night, your\ntravelling arrangements are affected. So observe carefully (you and\nMamie) all that I am going to say. It appears to me that the best course\nwill be for you to come to _Edinburgh_ on Saturday; taking the fast\ntrain from the Great Northern station at nine in the morning. This would\nbring you to the Waterloo at Edinburgh, at about nine or so at night,\nand I should be home at ten. We could then have a quiet Sunday in\nEdinburgh, and go over to Carlisle on the Monday morning.\n\nThe expenditure of lungs and spirits was (as you may suppose) rather\ngreat last night, and to sleep well was out of the question; I am\ntherefore rather fagged to-day. And as the hall in which I read to-night\nis a large one, I must make my letter a short one.\n\nMy people were torn to ribbons last night. They have not a hat among\nthem, and scarcely a coat.\n\nGive my love to Mamie. To her question, \"Will there be war with\nAmerica?\" I answer, \"Yes;\" I fear the North to be utterly mad, and war\nto be unavoidable.",

Also there\nwere two or three lines of his shipmates and other sailors, and they\nwere extraordinarily affected. But its culminating effect was on\nMacready at Cheltenham. When I got home after \"Copperfield,\" I found him\nquite unable to speak, and able to do nothing but square his dear old\njaw all on one side, and roll his eyes (half closed), like Jackson's\npicture of him.

Georgina and Mary keeping house for me; and Francis Jeffrey (I\nought to have counted him as the third boy, so we'll take him in here as\nnumber two and a half) in my office at present. Now you have the family\nbill of fare.\n\nYou ask me about Fechter and his Hamlet. It was a performance of\nextraordinary merit; by far the most coherent, consistent, and\nintelligible Hamlet I ever saw. Some of the delicacies with which he\nrendered his conception clear were extremely subtle; and in particular\nhe avoided that brutality towards Ophelia which, with a greater or less\namount of coarseness, I have seen in all other Hamlets. As a mere _tour\nde force_, it would have been very remarkable in its disclosure of a\nperfectly wonderful knowledge of the force of the English language; but\nits merit was far beyond and above this. Foreign accent, of course, but\nnot at all a disagreeable one. And he was so obviously safe and at ease,\nthat you were never in pain for him as a foreigner. Add to this a\nperfectly picturesque and romantic \"make up,\" and a remorseless\ndestruction of all conventionalities, and you have the leading virtues\nof the impersonation. In Othello he did not succeed. In Iago he is very\ngood. He is an admirable artist, and far beyond anyone on our stage. A\nreal artist and a gentleman.\n\nLast Thursday I began reading again in London--a condensation of\n\"Copperfield,\" and \"Mr. Bob Sawyer's Party,\" from \"Pickwick,\" to finish\nmerrily. The success of \"Copperfield\" is astounding. It made an\nimpression that _I_ must not describe. I may only remark that I was half\ndead when I had done; and that although I had looked forward, all\nthrough the summer, when I was carefully getting it up, to its being a\nLondon sensation; and that although Macready, hearing it at Cheltenham,\ntold me to be prepared for a great effect, it even went beyond my hopes.\nI read again next Thursday, and the rush for places is quite furious.\nTell Townshend this with my love, if you see him before I have time to\nwrite to him; and tell him that I thought the people would never let me\ngo away, they became so excited, and showed it so very warmly.

None the less do I thank you for your more\nthan kind proposal.\n\nWe have been in great anxiety respecting Miss Hogarth, the sudden\ndecline of whose health and spirits has greatly distressed us. Although\nshe is better than she was, and the doctors are, on the whole, cheerful,\nshe requires great care, and fills us with apprehension.

But in this world there is no\nstay but the hope of a better, and no reliance but on the mercy and\ngoodness of God. Through those two harbours of a shipwrecked heart, I\nfully believe that you will, in time, find a peaceful resting-place even\non this careworn earth. Heaven speed the time, and do you try hard to\nhelp it on! It is impossible to say but that our prolonged grief for the\nbeloved dead may grieve them in their unknown abiding-place, and give\nthem trouble. The one influencing consideration in all you do as to\nyour disposition of yourself (coupled, of course, with a real earnest\nstrenuous endeavour to recover the lost tone of spirit) is, that you\nthink and feel you _can_ do. I do not in the least regard your change of\ncourse in going to Havre as any evidence of instability. But I rather\nhope it is likely that through such restlessness you will come to a far\nquieter frame of mind. The disturbed mind and affections, like the\ntossed sea, seldom calm without an intervening time of confusion and\ntrouble.\n\nBut nothing is to be attained without striving. In a determined effort\nto settle the thoughts, to parcel out the day, to find occupation\nregularly or to make it, to be up and doing something, are chiefly to be\nfound the mere mechanical means which must come to the aid of the best\nmental efforts.\n\nIt is a wilderness of a day, here, in the way of blowing and raining,\nand as darkly dismal, at four o'clock, as need be. My head is but just\nnow raised from a day's writing, but I will not lose the post without\nsending you a word.\n\nKatie was here yesterday, just come back from Clara White's (that was),\nin Scotland. In the midst of her brilliant fortune, it is too clear to\nme that she is already beckoned away to follow her dead sisters.\nMacready was here from Saturday evening to yesterday morning, older but\nlooking wonderfully well, and (what is very rare in these times) with\nthe old thick sweep of hair upon his head. Georgina being left alone\nhere the other day, was done no good to by a great consternation among\nthe servants. On going downstairs, she found Marsh (the stableman)\nseated with great dignity and anguish in an arm-chair, and incessantly\ncrying out: \"I am dead.\" To which the women servants said with great\npathos (and with some appearance of reason): \"No, you ain't, Marsh!\" And\nto which he persisted in replying: \"Yes, I am; I am dead!\" Some\nneighbouring vagabond was impressed to drive a cart over to Rochester\nand fetch the doctor, who said (the patient and his consolers being all\nvery anxious that the heart should be the scene of affliction):\n\"Stomach.\"",

It is not to convey this insignificant piece of intelligence,\nor to tell you how anxious I am that you should come up with a wet sheet\nand a flowing sail (as we say at sea when we are not sick), that I\nwrite. It is simply to say what follows, which I hope may save you some\nmental uneasiness. For I was stricken ill when I was doing \"Bleak\nHouse,\" and I shall not easily forget what I suffered under the fear of\nnot being able to come up to time.\n\nDismiss that fear (if you have it) altogether from your mind. Write to\nme at Paris at any moment, and say you are unequal to your work, and\nwant me, and I will come to London straight and do your work. I am quite\nconfident that, with your notes and a few words of explanation, I could\ntake it up at any time and do it. Absurdly unnecessary to say that it\nwould be a makeshift! But I could do it at a pinch, so like you as that\nno one should find out the difference. Don't make much of this offer in\nyour mind; it is nothing, except to ease it. If you should want help, I\nam as safe as the bank. The trouble would be nothing to me, and the\ntriumph of overcoming a difficulty great. Think it a Christmas number,\nan \"Idle Apprentice,\" a \"Lighthouse,\" a \"Frozen Deep.\" I am as ready as\nin any of these cases to strike in and hammer the hot iron out.\n\nYou won't want me. You will be well (and thankless!) in no time. But\nthere I am; and I hope that the knowledge may be a comfort to you. Call\nme, and I come.\n\nAs Beard always has a sense of medical responsibility, and says anything\nimportant about a patient in confidence, I have merely remarked here\nthat \"Wilkie\" is out of sorts.

It is vigorously written with a great knowledge of the stage, and\npresents many striking situations. I think the close particularly fine,\nimpressive, bold, and new.\n\nBut I greatly doubt the expediency of your doing _any_ historical play\nearly in your management. By the words \"historical play,\" I mean a play\nfounded on any incident in English history. Our public are accustomed to\nassociate historical plays with Shakespeare. In any other hands, I\nbelieve they care very little for crowns and dukedoms. What you want is\nsomething with an interest of a more domestic and general nature--an\ninterest as romantic as you please, but having a more general and wider\nresponse than a disputed succession to the throne can have for\nEnglishmen at this time of day. Such interest culminated in the last\nStuart, and has worn itself out. It would be uphill work to evoke an\ninterest in Perkin Warbeck.\n\nI do not doubt the play's being well received, but my fear is that these\npeople would be looked upon as mere abstractions, and would have but a\ncold welcome in consequence, and would not lay hold of your audience.\nNow, when you _have_ laid hold of your audience and have accustomed them\nto your theatre, you may produce \"The White Rose,\" with far greater\njustice to the author, and to the manager also. Wait. Feel your way.\nPerkin Warbeck is too far removed from analogy with the sympathies and\nlives of the people for a beginning.\n\n                               My dear Fechter, ever faithfully yours.",

I saw her do it at about three\nin the morning of the day when the theatre opened, surrounded by\nshavings and carpenters, and (of course) with that inevitable hammer\ngoing; and I told Fechter: \"That is the very best piece of womanly\ntenderness I have ever seen on the stage, and you'll find that no\naudience can miss it.\" It is a comfort to add that it was instantly\nseized upon, and is much talked of.\n\nStanfield was very ill for some months, then suddenly picked up, and is\nreally rosy and jovial again. Going to see him when he was very\ndespondent, I told him the story of Fechter's piece (then in rehearsal)\nwith appropriate action; fighting a duel with the washing-stand, defying\nthe bedstead, and saving the life of the sofa-cushion. This so kindled\nhis old theatrical ardour, that I think he turned the corner on the\nspot.\n\nWith love to Mrs. Macready and Katie, and (be still my heart!)\nBenvenuta, and the exiled Johnny (not too attentive at school, I hope?),\nand the personally-unknown young Parr,\n\n                    Ever, my dearest Macready, your most affectionate.",

In my memory of the dear gentle little fellow, he will be (as\nsince those days he always has been) eternally posting up that book at\nthe large table in the middle of our Venice sitting-room, incidentally\nasking the name of an hotel three weeks back!

I have never seen, I\nthink, an intelligent and clear view of the whole character so well\nsustained throughout; and there is a very captivating air of romance and\npicturesqueness added, which is quite new. Rely upon it, the public were\nright. The thing could not have been sustained by oddity; it would have\nperished upon that, very soon. As to the mere accent, there is far less\ndrawback in that than you would suppose. For this reason, he obviously\nknows English so thoroughly that you feel he is safe. You are never in\npain for him. This sense of ease is gained directly, and then you think\nvery little more about it.\n\nThe Colenso and Jowett matter is a more difficult question, but\nhere again I don't go with you. The position of the writers of \"Essays\nand Reviews\" is, that certain parts of the Old Testament have done\ntheir intended function in the education of the world _as it was_;\nbut that mankind, like the individual man, is designed by the Almighty\nto have an infancy and a maturity, and that as it advances, the\nmachinery of its education must advance too. For example: inasmuch as\never since there was a sun and there was vapour, there _must have_ been\na rainbow under certain conditions, so surely it would be better now to\nrecognise that indisputable fact. Similarly, Joshua might command the\nsun to stand still, under the impression that it moved round the earth;\nbut he could not possibly have inverted the relations of the earth and\nthe sun, whatever his impressions were. Again, it is contended that the\nscience of geology is quite as much a revelation to man, as books of an\nimmense age and of (at the best) doubtful origin, and that your\nconsideration of the latter must reasonably be influenced by the former.\nAs I understand the importance of timely suggestions such as these, it\nis, that the Church should not gradually shock and lose the more\nthoughtful and logical of human minds; but should be so gently and\nconsiderately yielding as to retain them, and, through them, hundreds\nof thousands. This seems to me, as I understand the temper and tendency\nof the time, whether for good or evil, to be a very wise and necessary\nposition. And as I understand the danger, it is not chargeable on those\nwho take this ground, but on those who in reply call names and argue\nnothing. What these bishops and such-like say about revelation, in\nassuming it to be finished and done with, I can't in the least understand.\nNothing is discovered without God's intention and assistance, and I\nsuppose every new knowledge of His works that is conceded to man to be\ndistinctly a revelation by which men are to guide themselves. Lastly,\nin the mere matter of religious doctrine and dogmas, these men\n(Protestants--protestors--successors of the men who protested against\nhuman judgment being set aside) talk and write as if they were all\nsettled by the direct act of Heaven; not as if they had been, as we know\nthey were, a matter of temporary accommodation and adjustment among\ndisputing mortals as fallible as you or I.\n\nComing nearer home, I hope that Georgina is almost quite well. She has\nno attack of pain or flurry now, and is in all respects immensely\nbetter. Mary is neither married nor (that I know of) going to be. She\nand Katie and a lot of them have been playing croquet outside my window\nhere for these last four days, to a mad and maddening extent. My\nsailor-boy's ship, the _Orlando_, is fortunately in Chatham Dockyard--so\nhe is pretty constantly at home--while the shipwrights are repairing a\nleak in her. I am reading in London every Friday just now. Great crams\nand great enthusiasm. Townshend I suppose to have left Lausanne\nsomewhere about this day. His house in the park is hermetically sealed,\nready for him. The Prince and Princess of Wales go about (wisely) very\nmuch, and have as fair a chance of popularity as ever prince and\nprincess had. The City ball in their honour is to be a tremendously\ngorgeous business, and Mary is highly excited by her father's being\ninvited, and she with him. Meantime the unworthy parent is devising all\nkinds of subterfuges for sending her and getting out of it himself. A\nvery intelligent German friend of mine, just home from America,\nmaintains that the conscription will succeed in the North, and that the\nwar will be indefinitely prolonged. _I_ say \"No,\" and that however mad\nand villainous the North is, the war will finish by reason of its not\nsupplying soldiers.

It is often\nimpossible for me, by any means, to keep pace with my correspondents. I\nmust take leave to say, that if there be any general feeling on the part\nof the intelligent Jewish people, that I have done them what you\ndescribe as \"a great wrong,\" they are a far less sensible, a far less\njust, and a far less good-tempered people than I have always supposed\nthem to be. Fagin, in \"Oliver Twist,\" is a Jew, because it unfortunately\nwas true of the time to which that story refers, that that class of\ncriminal almost invariably was a Jew. But surely no sensible man or\nwoman of your persuasion can fail to observe--firstly, that all the rest\nof the wicked _dramatis person\u00e6_ are Christians; and secondly, that he\nis called the \"Jew,\" not because of his religion, but because of his\nrace. If I were to write a story, in which I described a Frenchman or a\nSpaniard as \"the Roman Catholic,\" I should do a very indecent and\nunjustifiable thing; but I make mention of Fagin as the Jew, because he\nis one of the Jewish people, and because it conveys that kind of idea of\nhim which I should give my readers of a Chinaman, by calling him a\nChinese.\n\nThe enclosed is quite a nominal subscription towards the good object in\nwhich you are interested; but I hope it may serve to show you that I\nhave no feeling towards the Jewish people but a friendly one. I always\nspeak well of them, whether in public or in private, and bear my\ntestimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such\ntransactions as I have ever had with them; and in my \"Child's History of\nEngland,\" I have lost no opportunity of setting forth their cruel\npersecution in old times.\n\n                                         Dear Madam, faithfully yours.\n\n\nIn reply to this, the Jewish lady thanks him for his kind letter and its\nenclosure, still remonstrating and pointing out that though, as he\nobserves, \"all the other criminal characters were Christians, they are,\nat least, contrasted with characters of good Christians; this wretched\nFagin stands alone as the Jew.\"\n\nThe reply to _this_ letter afterwards was the character of Riah, in \"Our\nMutual Friend,\" and some favourable sketches of Jewish character in the\nlower class, in some articles in \"All the Year Round.\"",

The Christmas number has been the greatest success of all; has\nshot ahead of last year; has sold about two hundred and twenty thousand;\nand has made the name of Mrs. Lirriper so swiftly and domestically\nfamous as never was. I had a very strong belief in her when I wrote\nabout her, finding that she made a great effect upon me; but she\ncertainly has gone beyond my hopes. (Probably you know nothing about\nher? which is a very unpleasant consideration.) Of the new book, I have\ndone the two first numbers, and am now beginning the third. It is a\ncombination of drollery with romance which requires a great deal of\npains and a perfect throwing away of points that might be amplified; but\nI hope it is _very good_. I confess, in short, that I think it is.\nStrange to say, I felt at first quite dazed in getting back to the large\ncanvas and the big brushes; and even now, I have a sensation as of\nacting at the San Carlo after Tavistock House, which I could hardly have\nsupposed would have come upon so old a stager.\n\nYou will have read about poor Thackeray's death--sudden, and yet not\nsudden, for he had long been alarmingly ill. At the solicitation of Mr.\nSmith and some of his friends, I have done what I would most gladly have\nexcused myself from doing, if I felt I could--written a couple of pages\nabout him in what was his own magazine.\n\nConcerning the Italian experiment, De la Rue is more hopeful than you.\nHe and his bank are closely leagued with the powers at Turin, and he has\nlong been devoted to Cavour; but he gave me the strongest assurances\n(with illustrations) of the fusion between place and place, and of the\nblending of small mutually antagonistic characters into one national\ncharacter, progressing cheeringly and certainly. Of course there must be\ndiscouragements and discrepancies in the first struggles of a country\npreviously so degraded and enslaved, and the time, as yet, has been very\nshort.\n\nI should like to have a day with you at the Coliseum, and on the Appian\nWay, and among the tombs, and with the Orvieto. But Rome and I are wide\nasunder, physically as well as morally. I wonder whether the dramatic\nstable, where we saw the marionettes, still receives the Roman public?\nAnd Lord! when I think of you in that hotel, how I think of poor dear\nEgg in the long front drawing-room, giving on to the piazza, posting up\nthat wonderful necromantic volume which we never shall see opened!",

I believe it to\nbe as honest, spirited, patient, reliable, and gallant a piece of\nbiography as ever was written, the care and pains of it astonishing, the\ncompleteness of it masterly; and what I particularly feel about it is\nthat the dignity of the man, and the dignity of the book that tells\nabout the man, always go together, and fit each other. This same quality\nhas always impressed me as the great leading speciality of the\nGoldsmith, and enjoins sympathy with the subject, knowledge of it, and\npursuit of it in its own spirit; but I think it even more remarkable\nhere. I declare that apart from the interest of having been so put into\nthe time, and enabled to understand it, I personally feel quite as much\nthe credit and honour done to literature by such a book. It quite clears\nout of the remembrance a thousand pitiful things, and sets one up in\nheart again. I am not surprised in the least by Bulwer's enthusiasm. I\nwas as confident about the effect of the book when I closed the first\nvolume, as I was when I closed the second with a full heart. No man less\nin earnest than Eliot himself could have done it, and I make bold to add\nthat it never could have been done by a man who was so distinctly born\nto do the work as Eliot was to do his.\n\nSaturday at Hastings I must give up. I have wavered and considered, and\nconsidered and wavered, but if I take that sort of holiday, I must have\na day to spare after it, and at this critical time I have not. If I were\nto lose a page of the five numbers I have purposed to myself to be\nready by the publication day, I should feel that I had fallen short.

It is remarkable that if you do not administer a\ndisagreeable character carefully, the public have a decided tendency to\nthink that the _story_ is disagreeable, and not merely the fictitious\nperson.\n\nWhat do you think of the title,\n\n                              NEVER FORGOTTEN?\n\nIt is a good one in itself, would express the eldest sister's pursuit,\nand glanced at now and then in the text, would hold the reader in\nsuspense. I would propose to add the line,\n\n                       BY THE AUTHOR OF BELLA DONNA.\n\nLet me know your opinion as to the title. I need not assure you that the\ngreatest care will be taken of you here, and that we shall make you as\nthoroughly well and widely known as we possibly can.\n\n                                                Very faithfully yours.",

This is an old story with me. I have\nnever divided a book of my writing with anything else, but have always\nwrought at it to the exclusion of everything else; and it is now too\nlate to change.\n\nAfter receiving your kind note I resolved to make another trial. But the\nhot weather and a few other drawbacks did not mend the matter, for I\nhave dropped astern this month instead of going ahead. So I have seen\nForster, and shown him my chains, and am reduced to taking exercise in\nthem, like Baron Trenck.\n\nI am heartily pleased that you set so much store by the dedication. You\nmay be sure that it does not make me the less anxious to take pains, and\nto work out well what I have in my mind.\n\nMary and Georgina unite with me in kindest regards to Lady Tennent and\nMiss Tennent, and wish me to report that while they are seriously\ndisappointed, they still feel there is no help for it. I can testify\nthat they had great pleasure in the anticipation of the visit, and that\ntheir faces were very long and blank indeed when I began to hint my\ndoubts. They fought against them valiantly as long as there was a\nchance, but they see my difficulty as well as anyone not myself can.\n\n                  Believe me, my dear Tennent, ever faithfully yours.",

But, as usual, when I have done my day's work, I jump up from my\ndesk and rush into air and exercise, and find letter-writing the most\ndifficult thing in my daily life.\n\nI hope that your asthmatic tendencies may not be strong just now; but\nTownshend's account of the premature winter at Lausanne is not\nencouraging, and with us here in England all such disorders have been\naggravated this autumn. However, a man of your dignity _must_ have\neither asthma or gout, and I hope you have got the better of the two.\n\nIn London there is, as you see by the papers, extraordinarily little\nnews. At present the apprehension (rather less than it was thought) of a\ncommercial crisis, and the trial of M\u00fcller next Thursday, are the two\nchief sensations. I hope that gentleman will be hanged, and have hardly\na doubt of it, though croakers contrariwise are not wanting. It is\ndifficult to conceive any other line of defence than that the\ncircumstances proved, taken separately, are slight. But a sound judge\nwill immediately charge the jury that the strength of the circumstances\nlies in their being put together, and will thread them together on a\nfatal rope.\n\nAs to the Church, my friend, I am sick of it. The spectacle presented by\nthe indecent squabbles of priests of most denominations, and the\nexemplary unfairness and rancour with which they conduct their\ndifferences, utterly repel me. And the idea of the Protestant\nestablishment, in the face of its own history, seeking to trample out\ndiscussion and private judgment, is an enormity so cool, that I wonder\nthe Right Reverends, Very Reverends, and all other Reverends, who commit\nit, can look in one another's faces without laughing, as the old\nsoothsayers did. Perhaps they can't and don't. How our sublime and\nso-different Christian religion is to be administered in the future I\ncannot pretend to say, but that the Church's hand is at its own throat I\nam fully convinced. Here, more Popery, there, more Methodism--as many\nforms of consignment to eternal damnation as there are articles, and all\nin one forever quarrelling body--the Master of the New Testament put out\nof sight, and the rage and fury almost always turning on the letter of\nobscure parts of the Old Testament, which itself has been the subject of\naccommodation, adaptation, varying interpretation without end--these\nthings cannot last. The Church that is to have its part in the coming\ntime must be a more Christian one, with less arbitrary pretensions and a\nstronger hold upon the mantle of our Saviour, as He walked and talked\nupon this earth.\n\nOf family intelligence I have very little. Charles Collins continuing in\na very poor way, and showing no signs of amendment. He and my daughter\nKatie went to Wiesbaden and thence to Nice, where they are now. I have\nstrong apprehensions that he will never recover, and that she will be\nleft a young widow. All the rest are as they were. Mary neither married\nnor going to be; Georgina holding them all together and perpetually\ncorresponding with the distant ones; occasional rallyings coming off\nhere, in which another generation begins to peep above the table. I once\nused to think what a horrible thing it was to be a grandfather. Finding\nthat the calamity falls upon me without my perceiving any other change\nin myself, I bear it like a man.\n\nMrs. Watson has bought a house in town, to which she repairs in the\nseason, for the bringing out of her daughter. She is now at Rockingham.\nHer eldest son is said to be as good an eldest son as ever was, and to\nmake her position there a perfectly independent and happy one. I have\nnot seen him for some years; her I often see; but he ought to be a good\nfellow, and is very popular in his neighbourhood.\n\nI have altered this place very much since you were here, and have made a\npretty (I think an unusually pretty) drawing-room. I wish you would come\nback and see it. My being on the Dover line, and my being very fond of\nFrance, occasion me to cross the Channel perpetually. Whenever I feel\nthat I have worked too much, or am on the eve of overdoing it, and want\na change, away I go by the mail-train, and turn up in Paris or anywhere\nelse that suits my humour, next morning. So I come back as fresh as a\ndaisy, and preserve as ruddy a face as though I never leant over a sheet\nof paper. When I retire from a literary life I think of setting up as a\nChannel pilot.\n\nPray give my love to Mrs. Cerjat, and tell her that I should like to go\nup the Great St. Bernard again, and shall be glad to know if she is open\nto another ascent. Old days in Switzerland are ever fresh to me, and\nsometimes I walk with you again, after dark, outside the hotel at\nMartigny, while Lady Mary Taylour (wasn't it?) sang within very\nprettily. Lord, how the time goes! How many years ago!\n\n                                                 Affectionately yours.\n\n\n                                     _Wednesday, Nov. 16th, 1864._[13]\n\nDEAR MADAM,\n\nI have received your letter with great pleasure, and hope to be (as I\nhave always been at heart) the best of friends with the Jewish people.\nThe error you point out to me had occurred to me, as most errors do to\nmost people, when it was too late to correct it. But it will do no harm.\nThe peculiarities of dress and manner are fused together for the sake of\npicturesqueness.\n\n                                         Dear Madam, faithfully yours.",

I can now again walk my ten\nmiles in the morning without inconvenience, but am absurdly obliged to\nsit shoeless all the evening--a very slight penalty, as I detest going\nout to dinner (which killed the original old Parr by-the-bye).\n\nI am working like a dragon at my book, and am a terror to the household,\nlikewise to all the organs and brass bands in this quarter. Gad's Hill\nis being gorgeously painted, and we are here until the 1st of June. I\nwish I might hope you would be there any time this summer; I really\n_have_ made the place comfortable and pretty by this time.\n\nIt is delightful to us to hear such good news of Butty. She made so\ndeep an impression on Fechter that he always asks me what Ceylon has\ndone for her, and always beams when I tell him how thoroughly well it\nhas made her. As to _you_, you are the youngest man (worth mentioning as\na thorough man) that I know. Oh, let me be as young when I am as----did\nyou think I was going to write \"old?\" No, sir--withdrawn from the wear\nand tear of busy life is my expression.\n\nPoole still holds out at Kentish Town, and says he is dying of solitude.\nHis memory is astoundingly good. I see him about once in two or three\nmonths, and in the meantime he makes notes of questions to ask me when I\ncome. Having fallen in arrear of the time, these generally refer to\nunknown words he has encountered in the newspapers. His three last (he\nalways reads them with tremendous difficulty through an enormous\nmagnifying-glass) were as follows:\n\n        1. What's croquet?\n        2. What's an Albert chain?\n        3. Let me know the state of mind of the Queen.\n\nWhen I had delivered a neat exposition on these heads, he turned back to\nhis memoranda, and came to something that the utmost power of the\nenormous magnifying-glass couldn't render legible. After a quarter of an\nhour or so, he said: \"O yes, I know.\" And then rose and clasped his\nhands above his head, and said: \"Thank God, I am not a dram-drinker.\"\n\nDo think of coming to Gad's in the summer; and do give my love to Mrs.\nMacready, and tell her I know she can make you come if she will. Mary\nand Georgy send best and dearest loves to her, to you, and to Katie, and\nto baby.

It was\ncaught upon the turn by some of the ruin of the bridge, and hung\nsuspended and balanced in an apparently impossible manner. Two ladies\nwere my fellow-passengers, an old one and a young one. This is exactly\nwhat passed. You may judge from it the precise length of the suspense:\nSuddenly we were off the rail, and beating the ground as the car of a\nhalf-emptied balloon might. The old lady cried out, \"My God!\" and the\nyoung one screamed. I caught hold of them both (the old lady sat\nopposite and the young one on my left), and said: \"We can't help\nourselves, but we can be quiet and composed. Pray don't cry out.\" The\nold lady immediately answered: \"Thank you. Rely upon me. Upon my soul I\nwill be quiet.\" We were then all tilted down together in a corner of the\ncarriage, and stopped. I said to them thereupon: \"You may be sure\nnothing worse can happen. Our danger _must_ be over. Will you remain\nhere without stirring, while I get out of the window?\" They both\nanswered quite collectedly, \"Yes,\" and I got out without the least\nnotion what had happened. Fortunately I got out with great caution and\nstood upon the step. Looking down I saw the bridge gone, and nothing\nbelow me but the line of rail. Some people in the two other compartments\nwere madly trying to plunge out at window, and had no idea that there\nwas an open swampy field fifteen feet down below them, and nothing else!\nThe two guards (one with his face cut) were running up and down on the\ndown side of the bridge (which was not torn up) quite wildly. I called\nout to them: \"Look at me. Do stop an instant and look at me, and tell me\nwhether you don't know me.\" One of them answered: \"We know you very\nwell, Mr. Dickens.\" \"Then,\" I said, \"my good fellow, for God's sake give\nme your key, and send one of those labourers here, and I'll empty this\ncarriage.\" We did it quite safely, by means of a plank or two, and when\nit was done I saw all the rest of the train, except the two baggage\nvans, down in the stream. I got into the carriage again for my brandy\nflask, took off my travelling hat for a basin, climbed down the\nbrickwork, and filled my hat with water.\n\nSuddenly I came upon a staggering man covered with blood (I think he\nmust have been flung clean out of his carriage), with such a frightful\ncut across the skull that I couldn't bear to look at him. I poured some\nwater over his face and gave him some to drink, then gave him some\nbrandy, and laid him down on the grass, and he said, \"I am gone,\" and\ndied afterwards. Then I stumbled over a lady lying on her back against a\nlittle pollard-tree, with the blood streaming over her face (which was\nlead colour) in a number of distinct little streams from the head. I\nasked her if she could swallow a little brandy and she just nodded, and\nI gave her some and left her for somebody else. The next time I passed\nher she was dead. Then a man, examined at the inquest yesterday (who\nevidently had not the least remembrance of what really passed), came\nrunning up to me and implored me to help him find his wife, who was\nafterwards found dead. No imagination can conceive the ruin of the\ncarriages, or the extraordinary weights under which the people were\nlying, or the complications into which they were twisted up among iron\nand wood, and mud and water.\n\nI don't want to be examined at the inquest, and I don't want to write\nabout it. I could do no good either way, and I could only seem to speak\nabout myself, which, of course, I would rather not do. I am keeping very\nquiet here. I have a--I don't know what to call it--constitutional (I\nsuppose) presence of mind, and was not in the least fluttered at the\ntime. I instantly remembered that I had the MS. of a number with me, and\nclambered back into the carriage for it. But in writing these scanty\nwords of recollection I feel the shake and am obliged to stop.\n\n                                                      Ever faithfully.",

The account is true, except\nthat I _had_ brandy. By an extraordinary chance I had a bottle and a\nhalf with me. I slung the half-bottle round my neck, and carried my hat\nfull of water in my hands.

The Frenchman was killed, and a labourer and I got Mr.\nDickenson out of a most extraordinary heap of dark ruins, in which he\nwas jammed upside down. He was bleeding at the eyes, ears, nose, and\nmouth; but he didn't seem to know that afterwards, and of course I\ndidn't tell him. In the moment of going over the viaduct the whole of\nhis pockets were shaken empty! He had no watch, no chain, no money, no\npocket-book, no handkerchief, when we got him out. He had been choking\na quarter of an hour when I heard him groaning. If I had not had the\nbrandy to give him at the moment, I think he would have been done for.\nAs it was, I brought him up to London in the carriage with me, and\ncouldn't make him believe he was hurt. He was the first person whom the\nbrandy saved. As I ran back to the carriage for the whole full bottle, I\nsaw the first two people I had helped lying dead. A bit of shade from\nthe hot sun, into which we got the unhurt ladies, soon had as many dead\nin it as living.\n\n                                              Faithfully yours always.",

How are\nyou? Asthmatic, I know you will reply; but as my poor father (who was\nasthmatic, too, and the jolliest of men) used philosophically to say,\n\"one must have something wrong, I suppose, and I like to know what it\nis.\"\n\nIn England we are groaning under the brigandage of the butcher, which is\nbeing carried to that height that I think I foresee resistance on the\npart of the middle-class, and some combination in perspective for\nabolishing the middleman, whensoever he turns up (which is everywhere)\nbetween producer and consumer. The cattle plague is the butcher's\nstalking-horse, and it is unquestionably worse than it was; but seeing\nthat the great majority of creatures lost or destroyed have been cows,\nand likewise that the rise in butchers' meat bears no reasonable\nproportion to the market prices of the beasts, one comes to the\nconclusion that the public is done. The commission has ended very weakly\nand ineffectually, as such things in England rather frequently do; and\neverybody writes to _The Times_, and nobody does anything else.\n\nIf the Americans don't embroil us in a war before long it will not be\ntheir fault. What with their swagger and bombast, what with their claims\nfor indemnification, what with Ireland and Fenianism, and what with\nCanada, I have strong apprehensions. With a settled animosity towards\nthe French usurper, I believe him to have always been sound in his\ndesire to divide the States against themselves, and that we were\nunsound and wrong in \"letting I dare not wait upon I would.\" The Jamaica\ninsurrection is another hopeful piece of business. That\nplatform-sympathy with the black--or the native, or the devil--afar off,\nand that platform indifference to our own countrymen at enormous odds in\nthe midst of bloodshed and savagery, makes me stark wild. Only the other\nday, here was a meeting of jawbones of asses at Manchester, to censure\nthe Jamaica Governor for his manner of putting down the insurrection! So\nwe are badgered about New Zealanders and Hottentots, as if they were\nidentical with men in clean shirts at Camberwell, and were to be bound\nby pen and ink accordingly. So Exeter Hall holds us in mortal submission\nto missionaries, who (Livingstone always excepted) are perfect\nnuisances, and leave every place worse than they found it.\n\nOf all the many evidences that are visible of our being ill-governed, no\none is so remarkable to me as our ignorance of what is going on under\nour Government. What will future generations think of that enormous\nIndian Mutiny being ripened without suspicion, until whole regiments\narose and killed their officers? A week ago, red tape, half-bouncing and\nhalf pooh-poohing what it bounced at, would have scouted the idea of a\nDublin jail not being able to hold a political prisoner. But for the\nblacks in Jamaica being over-impatient and before their time, the whites\nmight have been exterminated, without a previous hint or suspicion that\nthere was anything amiss. _Laissez aller_, and Britons never, never,\nnever!----\n\nMeantime, if your honour were in London, you would see a great\nembankment rising high and dry out of the Thames on the Middlesex shore,\nfrom Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars. A really fine work, and really\ngetting on. Moreover, a great system of drainage. Another really fine\nwork, and likewise really getting on. Lastly, a muddle of railways in\nall directions possible and impossible, with no general public scheme,\nno general public supervision, enormous waste of money, no fixable\nresponsibility, no accountability but under Lord Campbell's Act. I think\nof that accident in which I was preserved. Before the most furious and\nnotable train in the four-and-twenty hours, the head of a gang of\nworkmen takes up the rails. That train changes its time every day as the\ntide changes, and that head workman is not provided by the railway\ncompany with any clock or watch! Lord Shaftesbury wrote to me to ask me\nwhat I thought of an obligation on railway companies to put strong walls\nto all bridges and viaducts. I told him, of course, that the force of\nsuch a shock would carry away anything that any company could set up,\nand I added: \"Ask the minister what _he_ thinks about the votes of the\nrailway interest in the House of Commons, and about his being afraid to\nlay a finger on it with an eye to his majority.\"\n\nI seem to be grumbling, but I am in the best of humours. All goes well\nwith me and mine, thank God.\n\nLast night my gardener came upon a man in the garden and fired. The man\nreturned the compliment by kicking him in the groin and causing him\ngreat pain. I set off, with a great mastiff-bloodhound I have, in\npursuit. Couldn't find the evil-doer, but had the greatest difficulty in\npreventing the dog from tearing two policemen down. They were coming\ntowards us with professional mystery, and he was in the air on his way\nto the throat of an eminently respectable constable when I caught him.\n\nMy daughter Mary and her aunt Georgina send kindest regard and\nremembrance. Katey and her husband are going to try London this winter,\nbut I rather doubt (for they are both delicate) their being able to\nweather it out. It has been blowing here tremendously for a fortnight,\nbut to-day is like a spring day, and plenty of roses are growing over\nthe labourers' cottages. The _Great Eastern_ lies at her moorings beyond\nthe window where I write these words; looks very dull and unpromising. A\ndark column of smoke from Chatham Dockyard, where the iron shipbuilding\nis in progress, has a greater significance in it, I fancy.",

But I have\nonly seen it once; and it is so extraordinarily well done, that it ought\nto be observed closely several times.\n\nAnyone who attentively notices the flower trick will see that the two\nlittle high tables hung with drapery cover each a trap. Each of those\ntables, during that trick, hides a confederate, who changes the paper\ncone twice. When the cone has been changed as often as is required, the\ntrap is closed and the table can be moved.\n\nWhen the curtain is removed for the performance of the Sphinx trick,\nthere is a covered, that is, draped table on the stage, which is never\nseen before or afterwards. In front of the middle of it, and between it\nand the audience, stands one of those little draped tables covering a\ntrap; this is a third trap in the centre of the stage. The box for the\nhead is then upon IT, and the conjuror takes it off and shows it. The\nman whose head is afterwards shown in that box is, I conceive, in the\ntable; that is to say, is lying on his chest in the thickness of the\ntable, in an extremely constrained attitude. To get him into the table,\nand to enable him to use the trap in the table through which his head\ncomes into the box, the two hands of a confederate are necessary. That\nconfederate comes up a trap, and stands in the space afforded by the\ninterval below the stage and the height of the little draped table! his\nback is towards the audience. The moment he has assisted the hidden man\nsufficiently, he closes the trap, and the conjuror then immediately\nremoves the little draped table, and also the drapery of the larger\ntable; when he places the box on the last-named table _with the slide\non_ for the head to come into it, he stands with his back to the\naudience and his face to the box, and masks the box considerably to\nfacilitate the insertion of the head. As soon as he knows the head to be\nin its place, he undraws the slide. When the verses have been spoken and\nthe trick is done, he loses no time in replacing the slide. The curtain\nis then immediately dropped, because the man cannot otherwise be got out\nof the table, and has no doubt had quite enough of it. With kindest\nregards to all at Penton,\n\n                                          Ever your most affectionate.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[14] Now Captain E. Newton Dickenson.\n\n[15] This was a circular note which he sent in answer to innumerable\nletters of enquiry, after the accident.\n\n[16] This letter was written in reply to the Committee's congratulations\nupon Mr. Dickens's escape from the accident to the tidal train from\nFolkestone, at Staplehurst, just previous to this date.",

It is _an enormous\nsuccess_, and increases in attraction nightly. I have never seen the\npeople in all parts of the house so leaning forward, in lines sloping\ntowards the stage, earnestly and intently attractive, as while the story\ngradually unfolds itself. But the astonishing circumstance of all is,\nthat Miss Leclercq (never thought of for Lucy till all other Lucies had\nfailed) is marvellously good, highly pathetic, and almost unrecognisable\nin person! What note it touches in her, always dumb until now, I do not\npretend to say, but there is no one on the stage who could play the\ncontract scene better, or more simply and naturally, and I find it\nimpossible to see it without crying! Almost everyone plays well, the\nwhole is exceedingly picturesque, and there is scarcely a movement\nthroughout, or a look, that is not indicated by Scott.

Your patient tone, however, and the hopefulness and\nforbearance of Ferguson's course, gives us some reassurance. Apropos of\nwhich latter reference I dined with Ferguson at the Lord Mayor's, last\nTuesday, and had a grimly distracted impulse upon me to defy the\ntoast-master and rush into a speech about him and his noble art, when I\nsat pining under the imbecility of constitutional and corporational\nidiots. I did seize him for a moment by the hair of his head (in\nproposing the Lady Mayoress), and derived some faint consolation from\nthe company's response to the reference. O! no man will ever know under\nwhat provocation to contradiction and a savage yell of repudiation I\nsuffered at the hands of ----, feebly complacent in the uniform of\nMadame Tussaud's own military waxers, and almost the worst speaker I\never heard in my life! Mary and Georgina, sitting on either side of me,\nurged me to \"look pleasant.\" I replied in expressions not to be\nrepeated. Shea (the judge) was just as good and graceful, as he (the\nmember) was bad and gawky.\n\nBulwer's \"Lost Tales of Miletus\" is a most noble book! He is an\nextraordinary fellow, and fills me with admiration and wonder.\n\nIt is of no use writing to you about yourself, my dear Kent, because you\nare likely to be tired of that constant companion, and so I have gone\nscratching (with an exceedingly bad pen) about and about you. But I come\nback to you to let you know that the reputation of this house as a\nconvalescent hospital stands (like the house itself) very high, and that\ntestimonials can be produced from credible persons who have recovered\nhealth and spirits here swiftly.

BROOKFIELD,\n\nHaving gone through your MS. (which I should have done sooner, but that\nI have not been very well), I write these few following words about it.\nFirstly, with a limited reference to its unsuitability to these pages.\nSecondly, with a more enlarged reference to the merits of the story\nitself.\n\nIf you will take any part of it and cut it up (in fancy) into the small\nportions into which it would have to be divided here for only a month's\nsupply, you will (I think) at once discover the impossibility of\npublishing it in weekly parts. The scheme of the chapters, the manner of\nintroducing the people, the progress of the interest, the places in\nwhich the principal places fall, are all hopelessly against it. It would\nseem as though the story were never coming, and hardly ever moving.\nThere must be a special design to overcome that specially trying mode of\npublication, and I cannot better express the difficulty and labour of it\nthan by asking you to turn over any two weekly numbers of \"A Tale of Two\nCities,\" or \"Great Expectations,\" or Bulwer's story, or Wilkie\nCollins's, or Reade's, or \"At the Bar,\" and notice how patiently and\nexpressly the thing has to be planned for presentation in these\nfragments, and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted\nwhole.\n\nOf the story itself I honestly say that I think highly. The style is\nparticularly easy and agreeable, infinitely above ordinary writing, and\nsometimes reminds me of Mrs. Inchbald at her best. The characters are\nremarkably well observed, and with a rare mixture of delicacy and\ntruthfulness. I observe this particularly in the brother and sister, and\nin Mrs. Neville. But it strikes me that you constantly hurry your\nnarrative (and yet without getting on) _by telling it, in a sort of\nimpetuous breathless way, in your own person, when the people should\ntell it and act it for themselves_. My notion always is, that when I\nhave made the people to play out the play, it is, as it were, their\nbusiness to do it, and not mine. Then, unless you really have led up to\na great situation like Basil's death, you are bound in art to make more\nof it. Such a scene should form a chapter of itself. Impressed upon the\nreader's memory, it would go far to make the fortune of the book.\nSuppose yourself telling that affecting incident in a letter to a\nfriend. Wouldn't you describe how you went through the life and stir of\nthe streets and roads to the sick-room? Wouldn't you say what kind of\nroom it was, what time of day it was, whether it was sunlight,\nstarlight, or moonlight? Wouldn't you have a strong impression on your\nmind of how you were received, when you first met the look of the dying\nman, what strange contrasts were about you and struck you? I don't want\nyou, in a novel, to present _yourself_ to tell such things, but I want\nthe things to be there. You make no more of the situation than the index\nmight, or a descriptive playbill might in giving a summary of the\ntragedy under representation.\n\nAs a mere piece of mechanical workmanship, I think all your chapters\nshould be shorter; that is to say, that they should be subdivided.\nAlso, when you change from narrative to dialogue, or _vice vers\u00e2_, you\nshould make the transition more carefully. Also, taking the pains to sit\ndown and recall the principal landmarks in your story, you should then\nmake them far more elaborate and conspicuous than the rest. Even with\nthese changes I do not believe that the story would attract the\nattention due to it, if it were published even in such monthly portions\nas the space of \"Fraser\" would admit of. Even so brightened, it would\nnot, to the best of my judgment, express itself piecemeal. It seems to\nme to be so constituted as to require to be read \"off the reel.\" As a\nbook in two volumes I think it would have good claims to success, and\ngood chances of obtaining success. But I suppose the polishing I have\nhinted at (not a meretricious adornment, but positively necessary to\ngood work and good art) to have been first thoroughly administered.\n\nNow don't hate me if you can help it. I can afford to be hated by some\npeople, but I am not rich enough to put you in possession of that\nluxury.\n\n                                                Ever faithfully yours.\n\nP.S.--The MS. shall be delivered at your house to-morrow.

Great placards were posted about the town\nby the anxious Dolby, announcing that no money would be taken at the\ndoors. This kept the crowd off. Two files of policemen and a double\nstaff everywhere did the rest, and nothing could be better-tempered or\nmore orderly. Tremendous enthusiasm with the \"Carol\" and \"Trial.\" I was\ndead beat afterwards, that reading being twenty minutes longer than\nusual; but plucked up again, had some supper, slept well, and am quite\nright to-day.

The let at St. James's Hall is not\nonly immense for next Tuesday, but so large for the next reading\nafterwards, that Chappell writes: \"That will be the greatest house of\nthe three.\" From Manchester this morning they write: \"Send us more\ntickets instantly, for we are sold out and don't know what to do with\nthe people.\" Last night the whole of my money under the agreement had\nbeen taken. I notice that a great bank has broken at Liverpool, which\nmay hurt us there, but when last heard of it was going as before.

I wrote the usual refusal, and supposed Mrs. ---- to\nbe some romantic girl whom I had joked with, perhaps at Allison's or\nwhere not.

If the characters did not speak in a terse and\nhomely way, their idea and language would be inconsistent with their\ndress and station, and they would lose, as characters, before the\naudience. The dialogue seems to be exactly what is wanted. Its\nsimplicity (particularly in Mr. Boucicault's part) is often very\neffective; and throughout there is an honest, straight-to-the-purpose\nruggedness in it, like the real life and the real people.\n\nSecondly, as to the absence of the comic element. I really do not see\nhow more of it could be got into the story, and I think Mr. Boucicault\nunderrates the pleasant effect of his own part. The very notion of a\nsailor, whose life is not among those little courts and streets, and\nwhose business does not lie with the monotonous machinery, but with the\nfour wild winds, is a relief to me in reading the play. I am quite\nconfident of its being an immense relief to the audience when they see\nthe sailor before them, with an entirely different bearing, action,\ndress, complexion even, from the rest of the men. I would make him the\nfreshest and airiest sailor that ever was seen; and through him I can\ndistinctly see my way out of \"the Black Country\" into clearer air. (I\nspeak as one of the audience, mind.) I should like something of this\ncontrast to be expressed in the dialogue between the sailor and Jew, in\nthe second scene of the second act. Again, I feel Widdicomb's part\n(which is charming, and ought to make the whole house cry) most\nagreeable and welcome, much better than any amount in such a story, of\nmere comicality.\n\nIt is unnecessary to say that the play is done with a master's hand. Its\ncloseness and movement are quite surprising. Its construction is\nadmirable. I have the strongest belief in its making a great success.\nBut I must add this proviso: I never saw a play so dangerously depending\nin critical places on strict natural propriety in the manner and\nperfection in the shaping of the small parts. Those small parts cannot\ntake the play up, but they can let it down. I would not leave a hair on\nthe head of one of them to the chance of the first night, but I would\nsee, to the minutest particular, the make-up of every one of them at a\nnight rehearsal.\n\nOf course you are free to show this note to Mr. Boucicault, and I\nsuppose you will do so; let me throw out this suggestion to him and you.\nMight it not ease the way with the Lord Chamberlain's office, and still\nmore with the audience, when there are Manchester champions in it, if\ninstead of \"Manchester\" you used a fictitious name? When I did \"Hard\nTimes\" I called the scene Coketown. Everybody knew what was meant, but\nevery cotton-spinning town said it was the other cotton-spinning town.\n\nI shall be up on Saturday, and will come over about mid-day, unless you\nname any other time.\n\n                                                        Ever heartily.",

You could then add the second title, \"Being a\nHistory,\" etc.\n\nI don't at all desire to fix a limit to the series of old stories\nretold.

And yet he never\ndisobeyed me, unless he had first laid hold of a dog.\n\nYou heard of his going to execution, evidently supposing the procession\nto be a party detached in pursuit of something to kill or eat?

All the prizes I gave were in money, too. We had two\nthousand people here. Among the crowd were soldiers, navvies, and\nlabourers of all kinds. Not a stake was pulled up, or a rope slackened,\nor one farthing's-worth of damage done. To every competitor (only) a\nprinted bill of general rules was given, with the concluding words: \"Mr.\nDickens puts every man upon his honour to assist in preserving order.\"\nThere was not a dispute all day, and they went away at sunset rending\nthe air with cheers, and leaving every flag on a six hundred yards'\ncourse as neat as they found it when the gates were opened at ten in the\nmorning.

He went out very cheerfully with the half-dozen men told off\nfor the purpose, evidently thinking that they were going to be the death\nof somebody unknown. But observing in the procession an empty\nwheelbarrow and a double-barrelled gun, he became meditative, and fixed\nthe bearer of the gun with his eyes. A stone deftly thrown across him by\nthe village blackguard (chief mourner) caused him to look round for an\ninstant, and he then fell dead, shot through the heart. Two posthumous\nchildren are at this moment rolling on the lawn; one will evidently\ninherit his ferocity, and will probably inherit the gun.

Next morning I believe I start into\nthe country. When I read, I _don't_ write. I only edit, and have the\nproof-sheets sent me for the purpose. Here are your questions answered.\n\nAs to the Reform question, it should have been, and could have been,\nperfectly known to any honest man in England that the more intelligent\npart of the great masses were deeply dissatisfied with the state of\nrepresentation, but were in a very moderate and patient condition,\nawaiting the better intellectual cultivation of numbers of their\nfellows. The old insolent resource of assailing them and making the most\naudaciously wicked statements that they are politically indifferent,\nhas borne the inevitable fruit. The perpetual taunt, \"Where are they?\"\nhas called them out with the answer: \"Well then, if you _must_ know,\nhere we are.\" The intolerable injustice of vituperating the bribed to an\nassembly of bribers, has goaded their sense of justice beyond endurance.\nAnd now, what they would have taken they won't take, and whatever they\nare steadily bent upon having they will get. Rely upon it, this is the\nreal state of the case. As to your friend \"Punch,\" you will find him\nbegin to turn at the very selfsame instant when the new game shall\nmanifestly become the losing one. You may notice his shoes pinching him\na little already.\n\nMy dear fellow, I have no more power to stop that mutilation of my books\nthan you have. It is as certain as that every inventor of anything\ndesigned for the public good, and offered to the English Government,\nbecomes _ipso facto_ a criminal, to have his heart broken on the\ncircumlocutional wheel. It is as certain as that the whole Crimean story\nwill be retold, whenever this country again goes to war. And to tell the\ntruth, I have such a very small opinion of what the great genteel have\ndone for us, that I am very philosophical indeed concerning what the\ngreat vulgar may do, having a decided opinion that they can't do worse.\n\nThis is the time of year when the theatres do best, there being still\nnumbers of people who make it a sort of religion to see Christmas\npantomimes. Having my annual houseful, I have, as yet, seen nothing.\nFechter has neither pantomime nor burlesque, but is doing a new version\nof the old \"Trente Ans de la Vie d'un Joueur.\" I am afraid he will not\nfind his account in it. On the whole, the theatres, except in the\narticles of scenery and pictorial effect, are poor enough. But in some\nof the smaller houses there are actors who, if there were any dramatic\nhead-quarters as a school, might become very good. The most hopeless\nfeature is, that they have the smallest possible idea of an effective\nand harmonious whole, each \"going in\" for himself or herself. The\nmusic-halls attract an immense public, and don't refine the general\ntaste. But such things as they do are well done of their kind, and\nalways briskly and punctually.\n\nThe American yacht race is the last sensation. I hope the general\ninterest felt in it on this side will have a wholesome interest on that.\nIt will be a woeful day when John and Jonathan throw their caps into the\nring. The French Emperor is indubitably in a dangerous state. His\nParisian popularity wanes, and his army are discontented with him. I\nhear on high authority that his secret police are always making\ndiscoveries that render him desperately uneasy.\n\nYou know how we have been swindling in these parts. But perhaps you\ndon't know that Mr. ----, the \"eminent\" contractor, before he fell into\ndifficulties settled _one million of money_ on his wife. Such a good and\ndevoted husband!\n\nMy daughter Katie has been very ill of nervous fever. On the 27th of\nDecember she was in a condition to be brought down here (old high road\nand post-horses), and has been steadily getting better ever since. Her\nhusband is here too, and is on the whole as well as he ever is or ever\nwill be, I fear.\n\nWe played forfeit-games here, last night, and then pool. For a\nbilliard-room has been added to the house since you were here. Come and\nplay a match with me.\n\n                                                Always affectionately.",

That done, from my heart of hearts, I go on to\nmy small report of myself.\n\nThe readings have produced such an immense effect here that we are\ncoming back for two more in the middle of February. \"Marigold\" and the\n\"Trial,\" on Friday night, and the \"Carol,\" on Saturday afternoon, were a\nperfect furore; and the surprise about \"Barbox\" has been amusingly\ngreat. It is a most extraordinary thing, after the enormous sale of that\nChristmas number, that the provincial public seems to have combined to\nbelieve that it _won't_ make a reading. From Wolverhampton and Leeds we\nhave exactly the same expression of feelings _beforehand_. Exactly as I\nmade \"Copperfield\"--always to the poorest houses I had with Headland,\nand against that luminary's entreaty--so I should have to make this, if\nI hadn't \"Marigold\" always in demand.\n\nIt being next to impossible for people to come out at night with horses,\nwe have felt the weather in the stalls, and expect to do so through this\nweek. The half-crown and shilling publics have crushed to their places\nmost splendidly. The enthusiasm has been unbounded. On Friday night I\nquite astonished myself; but I was taken so faint afterwards that they\nlaid me on a sofa at the hall for half an hour. I attribute it to my\ndistressing inability to sleep at night, and to nothing worse.\n\nScott does very well indeed. As a dresser he is perfect. In a quarter of\nan hour after I go into the retiring-room, where all my clothes are\nairing and everything is set out neatly in its own allotted space, I am\nready; and he then goes softly out, and sits outside the door. In the\nmorning he is equally punctual, quiet, and quick. He has his needles and\nthread, buttons, and so forth, always at hand; and in travelling he is\nvery systematic with the luggage. What with Dolby and what with this\nskilful valet, everything is made as easy to me as it possibly _can_ be,\nand Dolby would do anything to lighten the work, and does everything.\n\nThere is great distress here among the poor (four thousand people\nrelieved last Saturday at one workhouse), and there is great anxiety\nconcerning _seven mail-steamers some days overdue_. Such a circumstance\nas this last has never been known. It is supposed that some great\nrevolving storm has whirled them all out of their course. One of these\nmissing ships is an American mail, another an Australian mail.\n\n\n                                                     _Same Afternoon._\n\nWe have been out for four hours in the bitter east wind, and walking on\nthe sea-shore, where there is a broad strip of great blocks of ice. My\nhands are so rigid that I write with great difficulty.\n\nWe have been constantly talking of the terrible Regent's Park accident.\nI hope and believe that nearly the worst of it is now known.",

There was a\nheavy swell in the Mersey breaking over the boat; the cold was nipping,\nand all the roads we saw as we came along were wretched. We find a very\nmoderate let here; but I am myself rather surprised to know that a\nhundred and twenty stalls have made up their minds to the undertaking of\ngetting to the hall. This seems to be a very nice hotel, but it is an\nextraordinarily cold one. Our reading for to-night is \"Marigold\" and\n\"Trial.\" With amazing perversity the local agent said to Dolby: \"They\nhoped that Mr. Dickens _might_ have given them 'The Boy at Mugby.'\"\n\nBarton, the gasman who succeeded the man who sprained his leg, sprained\n_his_ leg yesterday!! And that, not at his work, but in running\ndownstairs at the hotel. However, he has hobbled through it so far, and\nI hope will hobble on, for he knows his work.\n\nI have seldom seen a place look more hopelessly frozen up than this\nplace does. The hall is like a Methodist chapel in low spirits, and with\na cold in its head. A few blue people shiver at the corners of the\nstreets. And this house, which is outside the town, looks like an\nornament on an immense twelfth cake baked for 1847.\n\nI am now going to the fire to try to warm myself, but have not the least\nexpectation of succeeding. The sitting-room has two large windows in it,\ndown to the ground and facing due east. The adjoining bedroom (mine) has\nalso two large windows in it, down to the ground and facing due east.\nThe very large doors are opposite the large windows, and I feel as if I\nwere something to eat in a pantry.",

The\nlatter would assuredly damage your book, and be protested against to me.\nI have a conviction of it, founded on constant observation and\nexperience here.\n\nYour kind invitation is extremely welcome and acceptable to me, but I am\nsorry to add that I must not go a-visiting. For this reason: So\nincessantly have I been \"reading,\" that I have not once been at home at\nGad's Hill since last January, and am little likely to get there before\nthe middle of May. Judge how the master's eye must be kept on the place\nwhen it does at length get a look at it after so long an absence! I hope\nyou will descry in this a reason for coming to me again, instead of my\ncoming to you.\n\nThe extinct prize-fighters, as a body, I take to be a good subject, for\nmuch the same reason as George Barrington.

I have\nbeen almost constantly travelling and reading. England, Ireland, and\nScotland have laid hold of me by turns, and I have had no rest. As soon\nas I had finished this kind of work last year, I had to fall to work\nupon \"All the Year Round\" and the Christmas number. I was no sooner quit\nof that task, and the Christmas season was but run out to its last day,\nwhen I was tempted into another course of fifty readings that are not\nyet over. I am here now for two days, and have not seen the place since\nTwelfth Night. When a reading in London has been done, I have been\nbrought up for it from some great distance, and have next morning been\ncarried back again. But the fifty will be \"paid out\" (as we say at sea)\nby the middle of May, and then I hope to see you.\n\nReading at Cheltenham the other day, I saw Macready, who sent his love\nto you. His face was much more massive and as it used to be, than when I\nsaw him previous to his illness. His wife takes admirable care of him,\nand is on the happiest terms with his daughter Katie. His boy by the\nsecond marriage is a jolly little fellow, and leads a far easier life\nthan the children you and I remember, who used to come in at dessert and\nhave each a biscuit and a glass of water, in which last refreshment I\nwas always convinced that they drank, with the gloomiest malignity,\n\"Destruction to the gormandising grown-up company!\"\n\nI hope to look up your latest triumphs on the day of the Academy dinner.\nOf course as yet I have had no opportunity of even hearing of what\nanyone has done. I have been (in a general way) snowed up for four\nmonths. The locomotive with which I was going to Ireland was dug out of\nthe snow at midnight, in Wales. Both passages across were made in a\nfurious snowstorm. The snow lay ankle-deep in Dublin, and froze hard at\nBelfast. In Scotland it slanted before a perpetual east wind. In\nYorkshire, it derived novelty from thunder and lightning. Whirlwinds\neverywhere I don't mention.\n\nGod bless you and yours. If I look like some weather-beaten pilot when\nwe meet, don't be surprised. Any mahogany-faced stranger who holds out\nhis hand to you will probably turn out, on inspection, to be the old\noriginal Dick.\n\n                 Ever, my dear Stanny, your faithful and affectionate.\n\nP.S.--I wish you could have been with me (of course in a snowstorm) one\nday on the pier at Tynemouth. There was a very heavy sea running, and a\nperfect fleet of screw merchantmen were plunging in and out on the turn\nof the tide at high-water. Suddenly there came a golden horizon, and a\nmost glorious rainbow burst out, arching one large ship, as if she were\nsailing direct for heaven. I was so enchanted by the scene, that I\nbecame oblivious of a few thousand tons of water coming on in an\nenormous roller, and was knocked down and beaten by its spray when it\nbroke, and so completely wetted through and through, that the very\npockets in my pocket-book were full of sea.",

My idea of a course of readings\nin America is, that it would involve far less travelling than you\nsuppose, that the large first-class rooms would absorb the whole course,\nand that the receipts would be very much larger than your estimate,\nunless the demand for the readings is ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED ON ALL\nHANDS. There is considerable reason for this view of the case. And I can\nhardly think that all the speculators who beset, and all the private\ncorrespondents who urge me, are in a conspiracy or under a common\ndelusion.\n\n                                   \n\nI shall never rest much while my faculties last, and (if I know myself)\nhave a certain something in me that would still be active in rusting and\ncorroding me, if I flattered myself that I was in repose. On the other\nhand, I think that my habit of easy self-abstraction and withdrawal into\nfancies has always refreshed and strengthened me in short intervals\nwonderfully. I always seem to myself to have rested far more than I have\nworked; and I do really believe that I have some exceptional faculty of\naccumulating young feelings in short pauses, which obliterates a\nquantity of wear and tear.\n\nMy worldly circumstances (such a large family considered) are very good.\nI don't want money. All my possessions are free and in the best order.\nStill, at fifty-five or fifty-six, the likelihood of making a very great\naddition to one's capital in half a year is an immense consideration....\nI repeat the phrase, because there should be something large to set\nagainst the objections.\n\nI dine with Forster to-day, to talk it over. I have no doubt he will\nurge most of your objections and particularly the last, though American\nfriends and correspondents he has, have undoubtedly staggered him more\nthan I ever knew him to be staggered on the money question. Be assured\nthat no one can present any argument to me which will weigh more\nheartily with me than your kind words, and that whatever comes of my\npresent state of abeyance, I shall never forget your letter or cease to\nbe grateful for it.\n\n                                Ever, my dear Wills, faithfully yours.",

It\ngives a series of \"narratives,\" but it is a very curious story, wild,\nand yet domestic, with excellent character in it, and great mystery. It\nis prepared with extraordinary care, and has every chance of being a\nhit. It is in many respects much better than anything he has done. The\nquestion is, how shall we fill up the blank between Mabel's progress and\nWilkie? What do you think of proposing to Fitzgerald to do a story three\nmonths long? I daresay he has some unfinished or projected something by\nhim.\n\nI have an impression that it was not Silvester who tried Eliza Fenning,\nbut Knowles. One can hardly suppose Thornbury to make such a mistake,\nbut I wish you would look into the Annual Register. I have added a final\nparagraph about the unfairness of the judge, whoever he was. I\ndistinctly recollect to have read of his \"putting down\" of Eliza\nFenning's father when the old man made some miserable suggestion in his\ndaughter's behalf (this is not noticed by Thornbury), and he also\nstopped some suggestion that a knife thrust into a loaf adulterated with\nalum would present the appearance that these knives presented. But I may\nhave got both these points from looking up some pamphlets in Upcott's\ncollection which I once had.\n\nYour account of your journey reminds me of one of the latest American\nstories, how a traveller by stage-coach said to the driver: \"Did you\never see a snail, sir?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where did you meet him, sir?\" \"I\n_didn't_ meet him, sir!\" \"Wa'al, sir, I think you did, if you'll excuse\nme, for I'm damned if you ever overtook him.\"\n\nEver faithfully.",

A case of an abstracted shilling seems to\nhave been clearly brought home to him by Chappell's people, and they\nknow very well what _that_ means. I supposed a very clear keeping off\nfrom Anne's husband (whom I recommended for employment to Chappell) to\nhave been referable only to ----; but now I see how hopeless and unjust\nit would be to expect belief from him with two such cases within his\nknowledge.\n\nBut don't let the thing spoil your holiday. If we try to do our duty by\npeople we employ, by exacting their proper service from them on the one\nhand, and treating them with all possible consistency, gentleness, and\nconsideration on the other, we know that we do right. Their doing wrong\ncannot change our doing right, and that should be enough for us.\n\nSo I have given _my_ feathers a shake, and am all right again. Give\n_your_ feathers a shake, and take a cheery flutter into the air of\nHertfordshire.\n\nGreat reports from Dolby and also from Fields! But I keep myself quite\ncalm, and hold my decision in abeyance until I shall have book, chapter,\nand verse before me. Dolby hoped he could leave Uncle Sam on the 11th of\nthis month.\n\nSydney has passed as a lieutenant, and appeared at home yesterday, all\nof a sudden, with the consequent golden garniture on his sleeve, which\nI, God forgive me, stared at without the least idea that it meant\npromotion.\n\nI am glad you see a certain unlikeness to anything in the American\nstory. Upon myself it has made the strangest impression of reality and\noriginality!! And I feel as if I had read something (by somebody else),\nwhich I should never get out of my mind!!! The main idea of the\nnarrator's position towards the other people was the idea that I _had_\nfor my next novel in A. Y. R.

The weather was favourable for us\nuntil yesterday morning, when we got a head-wind which still stands by\nus. We have rolled and pitched, of course; but on the whole have been\nwonderfully well off. I have had headache and have felt faint once or\ntwice, _but have not been sick at all_. My spacious cabin is very noisy\nat night, as the most important working of the ship goes on outside my\nwindow and over my head; but it is very airy, and if the weather be bad\nand I can't open the window, I can open the door all night. If the\nweather be fine (as it is now), I can open both door and window, and\nwrite between them. Last night, I got a foot-bath under the dignified\ncircumstances of sitting on a camp-stool in my cabin, and having the\nbath (and my feet) in the passage outside. The officers' quarters are\nclose to me, and, as I know them all, I get reports of the weather and\nthe way we are making when the watch is changed, and I am (as I usually\nam) lying awake. The motion of the screw is at its slightest vibration\nin my particular part of the ship. The silent captain, reported gruff,\nis a very good fellow and an honest fellow. Kelly has been ill all the\ntime, and not of the slightest use, and is ill now. Scott always\ncheerful, and useful, and ready; a better servant for the kind of work\nthere never can have been. Young Lowndes has been fearfully sick until\nmid-day yesterday. His cabin is pitch dark, and full of blackbeetles. He\nshares mine until nine o'clock at night, when Scott carries him off to\nbed. He also dines with me in my magnificent chamber. This passage in\nwinter time cannot be said to be an enjoyable excursion, but I certainly\nam making it under the best circumstances. (I find Dolby to have been\nenormously popular on board, and to have known everybody and gone\neverywhere.)\n\nSo much for my news, except that I have been constantly reading, and\nfind that \"Pierra\" that Mrs. Hogge sent me by Katie to be a very\nremarkable book, not only for its grim and horrible story, but for its\nsuggestion of wheels within wheels, and sad human mysteries. Baker's\nsecond book not nearly so good as his first, but his first anticipated\nit.\n\nWe hope to get to Halifax either on Sunday or Monday, and to Boston\neither on Tuesday or Wednesday.

But it was\na dismal night indeed, and it was curious to see the change it had made\nin the faces of all the passengers yesterday. It cannot be denied that\nthese winter crossings are very trying and startling; while the\npersonal discomfort of not being able to wash, and the miseries of\ngetting up and going to bed, with what small means there are all\nsliding, and sloping, and slopping about, are really in their way\ndistressing.\n\nThis forenoon we made Cape Race, and are now running along at full speed\nwith the land beside us. Kelly still useless, and positively declining\nto show on deck. Scott, with an eight-day-old moustache, more super like\nthan ever. My foot (I hope from walking on the boarded deck) in a very\nshy condition to-day, and rather painful. I shaved this morning for the\nfirst time since Liverpool; dodging at the glass, very much like\nFechter's imitation of ----. The white cat that came off with us in the\ntender a general favourite. She belongs to the daughter of a Southerner,\nreturning with his wife and family from a two-years' tour in Europe.\n\n\n                                                       _Sunday, 17th._\n\nAt four o'clock this morning we got into bad weather again, and the\nstate of things at breakfast-time was unutterably miserable. Nearly all\nthe passengers in their berths--no possibility of standing on\ndeck--sickness and groans--impracticable to pass a cup of tea from one\npair of hands to another. It has slightly moderated since (between two\nand three in the afternoon I write), and the sun is shining, but the\nrolling of the ship surpasses all imagination or description.\n\nWe expect to be at Halifax about an hour after midnight, and this letter\nshall be posted there, to make certain of catching the return mail on\nWednesday. Boston is only thirty hours from Halifax.\n\nBest love to Mamie, and to Katie and Charley. I know you will report me\nand my love to Forster and Mrs. Forster. I write with great difficulty,\nwedged up in a corner, and having my heels on the paper as often as the\npen. Kelly worse than ever, and Scott better than ever.\n\nMy desk and I have just arisen from the floor.",

All the tickets for the first four readings here\n(all yet announced) were sold immediately on their being issued.\n\nYou know that I begin on the 2nd of December with \"Carol\" and \"Trial\"?\nShall be heartily glad to begin to count the readings off.\n\nThis is an immense hotel, with all manner of white marble public\npassages and public rooms. I live in a corner high up, and have a hot\nand cold bath in my bedroom (communicating with the sitting-room), and\ncomforts not in existence when I was here before. The cost of living is\nenormous, but happily we can afford it. I dine to-day with Longfellow,\nEmerson, Holmes, and Agassiz. Longfellow was here yesterday. Perfectly\nwhite in hair and beard, but a remarkably handsome and notable-looking\nman. The city has increased enormously in five-and-twenty years. It has\ngrown more mercantile--is like Leeds mixed with Preston, and flavoured\nwith New Brighton; but for smoke and fog you substitute an exquisitely\nbright light air. I found my rooms beautifully decorated (by Mrs.\nFields) with choice flowers, and set off by a number of good books. I am\nnot much persecuted by people in general, as Dolby has happily made up\nhis mind that the less I am exhibited for nothing the better. So our men\nsit outside the room door and wrestle with mankind.\n\nWe had speech-making and singing in the saloon of the _Cuba_ after the\nlast dinner of the voyage. I think I have acquired a higher reputation\nfrom drawing out the captain, and getting him to take the second in\n\"All's Well,\" and likewise in \"There's not in the wide world\" (your\nparent taking first), than from anything previously known of me on these\nshores. I hope the effect of these achievements may not dim the lustre\nof the readings. We also sang (with a Chicago lady, and a strong-minded\nwoman from I don't know where) \"Auld Lang Syne,\" with a tender\nmelancholy, expressive of having all four been united from our cradles.\nThe more dismal we were, the more delighted the company were. Once (when\nwe paddled i' the burn) the captain took a little cruise round the\ncompass on his own account, touching at the \"Canadian Boat Song,\" and\ntaking in supplies at \"Jubilate,\" \"Seas between us braid ha' roared,\"\nand roared like the seas themselves. Finally, I proposed the ladies in a\nspeech that convulsed the stewards, and we closed with a brilliant\nsuccess. But when you dine with Mr. Forster, ask him to read to you how\nwe got on at church in a heavy sea. Hillard has just been in and sent\nhis love \"to those dear girls.\" He has grown much older. He is now\nDistrict Attorney of the State of Massachusetts, which is a very good\noffice. Best love to your aunt and Katie, and Charley and all his house,\nand all friends.",

Dolby is\nover at New York, where we are at our wits' end how to keep tickets out\nof the hands of speculators. Morgan is staying with me; came yesterday\nto breakfast, and goes home to-morrow. Fields and Mrs. Fields also dined\nyesterday. She is a very nice woman, with a rare relish for humour and a\nmost contagious laugh. The Bostonians having been duly informed that I\nwish to be quiet, really leave me as much so as I should be in\nManchester or Liverpool. This I cannot expect to last elsewhere; but it\nis a most welcome relief here, as I have all the readings to get up. The\npeople are perfectly kind and perfectly agreeable. If I stop to look in\nat a shop-window, a score of passers-by stop; and after I begin to read,\nI cannot expect in the natural course of things to get off so easily.\nBut I every day take from seven to ten miles in peace.\n\nCommunications about readings incessantly come in from all parts of the\ncountry. We take no offer whatever, lying by with our plans until after\nthe first series in New York, and designing, if we make a furore there,\nto travel as little as possible. I fear I shall have to take Canada at\nthe end of the whole tour. They make such strong representations from\nMontreal and Toronto, and from Nova Scotia--represented by St. John's\nand Halifax--of the slight it would be to them, if I wound up with the\nStates, that I am shaken.\n\nIt is sad to see Longfellow's house (the house in which his wife was\nburnt) with his young daughters in it, and the shadow of that terrible\nstory. The young undergraduates of Cambridge (he is a professor there)\nhave made a representation to him that they are five hundred strong,\nand cannot get one ticket. I don't know what is to be done for them; I\nsuppose I must read there somehow. We are all in the clouds until I\nshall have broken ground in New York, as to where readings will be\npossible and where impossible.\n\nAgassiz is one of the most natural and jovial of men. I go out\na-visiting as little as I can, but still have to dine, and what is\nworse, sup pretty often. Socially, I am (as I was here before)\nwonderfully reminded of Edinburgh when I had many friends in it.\n\nYour account and Mamie's of the return journey to London gave me great\npleasure. I was delighted with your report of Wilkie, and not surprised\nby Chappell's coming out gallantly.\n\nMy anxiety to get to work is greater than I can express, because time\nseems to be making no movement towards home until I shall be reading\nhard. Then I shall begin to count and count and count the upward steps\nto May.\n\nIf ever you should be in a position to advise a traveller going on a sea\nvoyage, remember that there is some mysterious service done to the\nbilious system when it is shaken, by baked apples. Noticing that they\nwere produced on board the _Cuba_, every day at lunch and dinner, I\nthought I would make the experiment of always eating them freely. I am\nconfident that they did wonders, not only at the time, but in stopping\nthe imaginary pitching and rolling after the voyage is over, from which\nmany good amateur sailors suffer. I have hardly had the sensation at\nall, except in washing of a morning. At that time I still hold on with\none knee to the washing-stand, and could swear that it rolls from left\nto right. The _Cuba_ does not return until Wednesday, the 4th December.\nYou may suppose that every officer on board is coming on Monday, and\nthat Dolby has provided extra stools for them. His work is very hard\nindeed. Cards are brought to him every minute in the day; his\ncorrespondence is immense; and he is jerked off to New York, and I don't\nknow where else, on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable times.\nMoreover, he has to be at \"the bar\" every night, and to \"liquor up with\nall creation\" in the small hours. He does it all with the greatest good\nhumour, and flies at everybody who waylays the Chief, furiously. We have\ndivided our men into watches, so that one always sits outside the\ndrawing-room door. Dolby knows the whole Cunard line, and as we could\nnot get good English gin, went out in a steamer yesterday and got two\ncases (twenty-four bottles) out of Cunard officers. Osgood and he were\ndetached together last evening for New York, whence they telegraph every\nother hour about some new point in this precious sale of tickets. So\ndistracted a telegram arrived at three that I have telegraphed back,\n\"Explain yourselves,\" and am now waiting for the explanation. I think\nyou know that Osgood is a partner in Ticknor and Fields'.\n\nTuesday morning.--Dolby has come back from New York, where the prospects\nseem immense. We sell tickets there next Friday and Saturday, and a\ntremendous rush is expected.",

These screws are tremendous ships for\ncarrying on, and for rolling, and their vibration is rather distressing.\nBut my little cabin, being for'ard of the machinery, was in the best\npart of the vessel, and I had as much air in it, night and day, as I\nchose. The saloon being kept absolutely without air, I mostly dined in\nmy own den, in spite of my being allotted the post of honour on the\nright hand of the captain.\n\nThe tickets for the first four readings here (the only readings\nannounced) were all sold immediately, and many are now re-selling at a\nlarge premium. The tickets for the first four readings in New York (the\nonly readings announced there also) were on sale yesterday, and were all\nsold in a few hours. The receipts are very large indeed; but engagements\nof any kind and every kind I steadily refuse, being resolved to take\nwhat is to be taken myself. Dolby is nearly worked off his legs, is now\nat New York, and goes backwards and forwards between this place and that\n(about the distance from London to Liverpool, though they take nine\nhours to do it) incessantly. Nothing can exceed his energy and good\nhumour, and he is extremely popular everywhere. My great desire is to\navoid much travelling, and to try to get the people to come to me,\ninstead of my going to them. If I can effect this to any moderate\nextent, I shall be saved a great deal of knocking about. My original\npurpose was not to go to Canada at all; but Canada is so up in arms on\nthe subject that I think I shall be obliged to take it at last. In that\ncase I should work round to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then take the\npacket for home.\n\nAs they don't seem (Americans who have heard me on their travels\nexcepted) to have the least idea here of what the readings are like, and\nas they are accustomed to mere readings out of a book, I am inclined to\nthink the excitement will increase when I shall have begun. Everybody\nis very kind and considerate, and I have a number of old friends here,\nat the Bar and connected with the University. I am now negotiating to\nbring out the dramatic version of \"No Thoroughfare\" at New York. It is\nquite upon the cards that it may turn up trumps.\n\nI was interrupted in that place by a call from my old secretary in the\nStates, Mr. Putnam. It was quite affecting to see his delight in meeting\nhis old master again. And when I told him that Anne was married, and\nthat I had (unacknowledged) grandchildren, he laughed and cried\ntogether. I suppose you don't remember Longfellow, though he remembers\nyou in a black velvet frock very well. He is now white-haired and\nwhite-bearded, but remarkably handsome. He still lives in his old house,\nwhere his beautiful wife was burnt to death. I dined with him the other\nday, and could not get the terrific scene out of my imagination. She was\nin a blaze in an instant, rushed into his arms with a wild cry, and\nnever spoke afterwards.\n\nMy love to Bessie, and to Mekitty, and all the babbies. I will lay this\nby until Tuesday morning, and then add a final line to it.\n\n                      Ever, my dear Charley, your affectionate Father.\n\n\n                                            _Tuesday, Dec. 3rd, 1867._\n\nSuccess last night beyond description or exaggeration.

As I left Halifax in\nthe _Cuba_ that very day, you probably saw us telegraphed in _The Times_\non the 19th.\n\nDolby came back from another run to New York, this morning. The receipts\nare very large indeed, far exceeding our careful estimate made at Gad's.\nI think you had best in future (unless I give you intimation to the\ncontrary) address your letters to me, at the Westminster Hotel, Irving\nPlace, New York City. It is a more central position than this, and we\nare likely to be much more there than here. I am going to set up a\nbrougham in New York, and keep my rooms at that hotel. The account of\nMatilda is a very melancholy one, and really distresses me. What she\nmust sink into, it is sad to consider. However, there was nothing for it\nbut to send her away, that is quite clear.\n\nThey are said to be a very quiet audience here, appreciative but not\ndemonstrative. I shall try to change their character a little.\n\nI have been going on very well. A horrible custom obtains in these parts\nof asking you to dinner somewhere at half-past two, and to supper\nsomewhere else about eight. I have run this gauntlet more than once, and\nits effect is, that there is no day for any useful purpose, and that the\nlength of the evening is multiplied by a hundred. Yesterday I dined with\na club at half-past two, and came back here at half-past eight, with a\ngeneral impression that it was at least two o'clock in the morning. Two\ndays before I dined with Longfellow at half-past two, and came back at\neight, supposing it to be midnight. To-day we have a state dinner-party\nin our rooms at six, Mr. and Mrs. Fields, and Mr. and Mrs. Bigelow. (He\nis a friend of Forster's, and was American Minister in Paris). There are\nno negro waiters here, all the servants are Irish--willing, but not\nable. The dinners and wines are very good. I keep our own rooms well\nventilated by opening the windows, but no window is ever opened in the\nhalls or passages, and they are so overheated by a great furnace, that\nthey make me faint and sick. The air is like that of a pre-Adamite\nironing-day in full blast. Your respected parent is immensely popular in\nBoston society, and its cordiality and unaffected heartiness are\ncharming. I wish I could carry it with me.\n\nThe leading New York papers have sent men over for to-morrow night with\ninstructions to telegraph columns of descriptions. Great excitement and\nexpectation everywhere. Fields says he has looked forward to it so long\nthat he knows he will die at five minutes to eight.\n\nAt the New York barriers, where the tickets are on sale and the people\nranged as at the Paris theatres, speculators went up and down offering\n\"twenty dollars for anybody's place.\" The money was in no case accepted.\nOne man sold two tickets for the second, third, and fourth night for\n\"one ticket for the first, fifty dollars\" (about seven pounds ten\nshillings), \"and a brandy cocktail,\" which is an iced bitter drink. The\nweather has been rather muggy and languid until yesterday, when there\nwas the coldest wind blowing that I ever felt. In the night it froze\nvery hard, and to-day the sky is beautiful.\n\n\n                                                  _Tuesday, Dec. 3rd._\n\nMost magnificent reception last night, and most signal and complete\nsuccess. Nothing could be more triumphant. The people will hear of\nnothing else and talk of nothing else. Nothing that was ever done here,\nthey all agree, evoked any approach to such enthusiasm. I was quite as\ncool and quick as if I were reading at Greenwich, and went at it\naccordingly. Tell your aunt, with my best love, that I have this morning\nreceived hers of the 21st, and that I will write to her next. That will\nbe from New York.

I got Scott up directly, told him\nto pack the books and clothes for the readings first, dressed, and\npocketed my jewels and papers, while Dolby stuffed himself out with\nmoney. Meanwhile the police and firemen were in the house, endeavouring\nto find where the fire was.

I read it at my ten o'clock\ndinner with the greatest interest and pleasure, and then we talked of\nhome till we went to bed.\n\nOur tour is now being made out, and I hope to be able to send it in my\nnext letter home, which will be to Mamie, from whom I have _not_ heard\n(as you thought I had) by the mail that brought out yours. After very\ncareful consideration I have reversed Dolby's original plan, and have\ndecided on taking Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, _Chicago_ (!), St.\nLouis, and a few other places nearer here, instead of staying in New\nYork. My reason is that we are doing immensely, both at New York and\nhere, and that I am sure it is in the peculiar character of the people\nto prize a thing the more the less easily attainable it is made.\nTherefore, I want, by absence, to get the greatest rush and pressure\nupon the five farewell readings in New York in April. All our announced\nreadings are already crammed.\n\nWhen we got here last Saturday night, we found that Mrs. Fields had not\nonly garnished the rooms with flowers, but also with holly (with real\nred berries) and festoons of moss dependent from the looking-glasses and\npicture frames. She is one of the dearest little women in the world. The\nhomely Christmas look of the place quite affected us. Yesterday we dined\nat her house, and there was a plum-pudding, brought on blazing, and not\nto be surpassed in any house in England. There is a certain Captain\nDolliver, belonging to the Boston Custom House, who came off in the\nlittle steamer that brought me ashore from the _Cuba_. He took it into\nhis head that he would have a piece of English mistletoe brought out in\nthis week's Cunard, which should be laid upon my breakfast-table. And\nthere it was this morning. In such affectionate touches as this, these\nNew England people are especially amiable.\n\nAs a general rule, you may lay it down that whatever you see about me in\nthe papers is not true. But although my voyage out was of that highly\nhilarious description that you first made known to me, you may\n_generally_ lend a more believing ear to the Philadelphia correspondent\nof _The Times_. I don't know him, but I know the source from which he\nderives his information, and it is a very respectable one.\n\nDid I tell you in a former letter from here, to tell Anne, with her old\nmaster's love, that I had seen Putnam, my old secretary? Grey, and with\nseveral front teeth out, but I would have known him anywhere. He is\ncoming to \"Copperfield\" to-night, accompanied by his wife and daughter,\nand is in the seventh heaven at having his tickets given him.\n\nOur hotel in New York was on fire _again_ the other night. But fires in\nthis country are quite matters of course. There was a large one there at\nfour this morning, and I don't think a single night has passed since I\nhave been under the protection of the Eagle, but I have heard the fire\nbells dolefully clanging all over the city.\n\nDolby sends his kindest regard. His hair has become quite white, the\neffect, I suppose, of the climate. He is so universally hauled over the\ncoals (for no reason on earth), that I fully expect to hear him, one of\nthese nights, assailed with a howl when he precedes me to the platform\nsteps. You may conceive what the low newspapers are here, when one of\nthem yesterday morning had, as an item of news, the intelligence:\n\"Dickens's Readings. The chap calling himself Dolby got drunk last\nnight, and was locked up in a police-station for fighting an Irishman.\"\nI don't find that anybody is shocked by this liveliness.\n\nMy love to all, and to Mrs. Hulkes and the boy. By-the-bye, when we left\nNew York for this place, Dolby called my amazed attention to the\ncircumstance that Scott was leaning his head against the side of the\ncarriage and weeping bitterly. I asked him what was the matter, and he\nreplied: \"The owdacious treatment of the luggage, which was more\noutrageous than a man could bear.\" I told him not to make a fool of\nhimself; but they do knock it about cruelly. I think every trunk we have\nis already broken.\n\nI must leave off, as I am going out for a walk in a bright sunlight and\na complete break-up of the frost and snow. I am much better than I have\nbeen during the last week, but have a cold.",

I wanted it very much, for I had a frightful cold (English colds\nare nothing to those of this country), and was exceedingly depressed and\nmiserable. Not that I had any reason but illness for being so, since the\nBostonians had been quite astounding in their demonstrations. I never\nsaw anything like them on Christmas Eve. But it is a bad country to be\nunwell and travelling in; you are one of say a hundred people in a\nheated car, with a great stove in it, and all the little windows closed,\nand the hurrying and banging about are indescribable. The atmosphere is\ndetestable, and the motion often all but intolerable. However, we got\nour dinner here at eight o'clock, and plucked up a little, and I made\nsome hot gin punch to drink a merry Christmas to all at home in. But it\nmust be confessed that we were both very dull. I have been in bed all\nday until two o'clock, and here I am now (at three o'clock) a little\nbetter. But I am not fit to read, and I must read to-night. After\nwatching the general character pretty closely, I became quite sure that\nDolby was wrong on the length of the stay and the number of readings we\nhad proposed in this place. I am quite certain that it is one of the\nnational peculiarities that what they want must be difficult of\nattainment. I therefore a few days ago made a _coup d'\u00e9tat_, and altered\nthe whole scheme. We shall go to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,\nalso some New England towns between Boston and this place, away to the\nfalls of Niagara, and off far west to Chicago and St. Louis, before\ncoming back for ten farewell readings here, preceded by farewells at\nBoston, leaving Canada altogether. This will not prolong the list beyond\neighty-four readings, the exact original number, and will, please God,\nwork it all out in April. In my next, I daresay, I shall be able to send\nthe exact list, so that you may know every day where we are. There has\nbeen a great storm here for a few days, and the streets, though wet, are\nbecoming passable again. Dolby and Osgood are out in it to-day on a\nvariety of business, and left in grave and solemn state. Scott and the\ngasman are stricken with dumb concern, not having received one single\nletter from home since they left. What their wives can have done with\nthe letters they take it for granted they have written, is their stormy\nspeculation at the door of my hall dressing-room every night.\n\nIf I do not send a letter to Katie by this mail, it will be because I\nshall probably be obliged to go across the water to Brooklyn to-morrow\nto see a church, in which it is proposed that I shall read!!! Horrible\nvisions of being put in the pulpit already beset me. And whether the\naudience will be in pews is another consideration which greatly disturbs\nmy mind. No paper ever comes out without a leader on Dolby, who of\ncourse reads them all, and never can understand why I don't, in which he\nis called all the bad names in (and not in) the language.\n\nWe always call him P. H. Dolby now, in consequence of one of these\ngraceful specimens of literature describing him as the \"pudding-headed.\"\n\nI fear that when we travel he will have to be always before me, so that\nI may not see him six times in as many weeks. However, I shall have done\na fourth of the whole this very next week!\n\nBest love to your aunt, and the boys, and Katie, and Charley, and all\ntrue friends.\n\n\n                                                             _Friday._\n\nI managed to read last night, but it was as much as I could do. To-day I\nam so very unwell, that I have sent for a doctor; he has just been, and\nis in doubt whether I shall not have to stop reading for a while.",

I want\nthat book, and a copy of Praed's poems, to be sent out to Boston, care\nof Ticknor and Fields. If you will give the \"Criminal Trials\" to Wills,\nand explain my wish, and ask him to buy a copy of Praed's poems and add\nit to the parcel, he will know how to send the packet out. I think the\n\"Criminal Trials\" book is in the corner book-case, by the window,\nopposite the door.\n\nNo news here. All going on in the regular way. I read in that church I\ntold you of, about the middle of January. It is wonderfully seated for\ntwo thousand people, and is as easy to speak in as if they were two\nhundred. The people are seated in pews, and we let the pews. I stood on\na small platform from which the pulpit will be removed for the\noccasion!! I emerge from the vestry!!! Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\nanother two nights in Boston will follow this coming month of January.\nOn Friday next I shall have read a fourth of my whole list, besides\nhaving had twelve days' holiday when I first came out. So please God I\nshall soon get to the half, and so begin to work hopefully round.\n\nI suppose you were at the Adelphi on Thursday night last. They are\npirating the bill as well as the play here, everywhere. I have\nregistered the play as the property of an American citizen, but the law\nis by no means clear that I established a right in it by so doing; and\nof course the pirates knew very well that I could not, under existing\ncircumstances, try the question with them in an American court of law.\nNothing is being played here scarcely that is not founded on my\nbooks--\"Cricket,\" \"Oliver Twist,\" \"Our Mutual Friend,\" and I don't know\nwhat else, every night. I can't get down Broadway for my own portrait;\nand yet I live almost as quietly in this hotel, as if I were at the\noffice, and go in and out by a side door just as I might there.\n\nI go back to Boston on Saturday to read there on Monday and Tuesday.\nThen I am back here, and keep within six or seven hours' journey of\nhereabouts till February. My further movements shall be duly reported as\nthe details are arranged.\n\nI shall be curious to know who were at Gad's Hill on Christmas Day, and\nhow you (as they say in this country) \"got along.\" It is exceedingly\ncold here again, after two or three quite spring days.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[17] Madame Sainton Dolby.\n\n[18] The nearest neighbour at Higham, and intimate friends.\n\n[19] Dr. Fordyce Barker.",

I\nread here to-night, and go back to Boston to-morrow, to read there\nMonday and Tuesday.\n\nTo-night, I read out the first quarter of my list. Our houses have been\nvery fine here, but have never quite recovered the Dolby uproar. It\nseems impossible to devise any scheme for getting the tickets into the\npeople's hands without the intervention of speculators. The people _will\nnot_ help themselves; and, of course, the speculators and all other such\nprowlers throw as great obstacles in Dolby's way (an Englishman's) as\nthey possibly can. He may be a little injudicious into the bargain. Last\nnight, for instance, he met one of the \"ushers\" (who show people to\ntheir seats) coming in with Kelly. It is against orders that anyone\nemployed in front should go out during the readings, and he took this\nman to task in the British manner. Instantly the free and independent\nusher put on his hat and walked off. Seeing which, all the other free\nand independent ushers (some twenty in number) put on _their_ hats and\nwalked off, leaving us absolutely devoid and destitute of a staff for\nto-night. One has since been improvised; but it was a small matter to\nraise a stir and ill will about, especially as one of our men was\nequally in fault.\n\nWe have a regular clerk, a Bostonian whose name is Wild. He, Osgood,\nDolby, Kelly, Scott, George the gasman, and perhaps a boy or two,\nconstitute my body-guard. It seems a large number of people, but the\nbusiness cannot be done with fewer. The speculators buying the front\nseats to sell at a premium (and we have found instances of this being\ndone by merchants in good position!), and the public perpetually\npitching into Dolby for selling them back seats, the result is that they\nwon't have the back seats, send back their tickets, write and print\nvolumes on the subject, and deter others from coming.\n\nYou may get an idea of the staff's work, by what is in hand now. They\nare preparing, numbering, and stamping six thousand tickets for\nPhiladelphia, and eight thousand tickets for Brooklyn. The moment those\nare done, another eight thousand tickets will be wanted for Baltimore,\nand probably another six thousand for Washington. This in addition to\nthe correspondence, advertisements, accounts, travellings, and the\nmighty business of the reading four times a week.\n\nThe Cunard steamers being now removed from Halifax, I have decided _not_\nto go there, or to St. John's, New Brunswick. And as there would be a\nperfect uproar if I picked out such a place in Canada as Quebec or\nMontreal, and excluded those two places (which would guarantee three\nhundred pounds a night), and further, as I don't want places, having\nmore than enough for my list of eighty-four, I have finally resolved not\nto go to Canada either. This will enable me to embark for home in April\ninstead of May.\n\nTell Plorn, with my love, that I think he will find himself much\ninterested at that college,[20] and that it is very likely he may make\nsome acquaintances there that will thereafter be pleasant and useful to\nhim. Sir Sydney Dacres is the best of friends. I have a letter from Mrs.\nHulkes by this post, wherein the boy encloses a violet, now lying on the\ntable before me. Let her know that it arrived safely, and retaining its\ncolour. I took it for granted that Mary would have asked Chorley for\nChristmas Day, and am very glad she ultimately did so. I am sorry that\nHarry lost his prize, but believe it was not his fault. Let _him_ know\n_that_, with my love. I would have written to him by this mail in answer\nto his, but for other occupation. Did I tell you that my landlord made\nme a drink (brandy, rum, and snow the principal ingredients) called a\n\"Rocky Mountain sneezer\"? Or that the favourite drink before you get up\nis an \"eye-opener\"? Or that Roberts (second landlord), no sooner saw me\non the night of the first fire, than, with his property blazing, he\ninsisted on taking me down into a roomful of hot smoke to drink brandy\nand water with him? We have not been on fire again, by-the-bye, more\nthan once.\n\nThere has been another fall of snow, succeeded by a heavy thaw. I have\nlaid down my sledge, and taken up my carriage again, in consequence. I\nam nearly all right, but cannot get rid of an intolerable cold in the\nhead. No more news.",

The work is hard and the climate is hard. We made a tremendous hit\nlast night with \"Nickleby\" and \"Boots,\" which the Bostonians certainly\non the whole appreciate more than \"Copperfield\"! Dolby is always going\nabout with an immense bundle that looks like a sofa cushion, but it is\nin reality paper money; and always works like a Trojan. His business at\nnight is a mere nothing, for these people are so accustomed to take care\nof themselves, that one of these immense audiences will fall into their\nplaces with an ease amazing to a frequenter of St. James's Hall. And the\ncertainty with which they are all in, before I go on, is a very\nacceptable mark of respect. I must add, too, that although there is a\nconventional familiarity in the use of one's name in the newspapers as\n\"Dickens,\" \"Charlie,\" and what not, I do not in the least see that\nfamiliarity in the writers themselves. An inscrutable tone obtains in\njournalism, which a stranger cannot understand. If I say in common\ncourtesy to one of them, when Dolby introduces, \"I am much obliged to\nyou for your interest in me,\" or so forth, he seems quite shocked, and\nhas a bearing of perfect modesty and propriety. I am rather inclined to\nthink that they suppose their printed tone to be the public's love of\nsmartness, but it is immensely difficult to make out. All I can as yet\nmake out is, that my perfect freedom from bondage, and at any moment to\ngo on or leave off, or otherwise do as I like, is the only safe position\nto occupy.\n\nAgain; there are two apparently irreconcilable contrasts here. Down\nbelow in this hotel every night are the bar loungers, dram drinkers,\ndrunkards, swaggerers, loafers, that one might find in a Boucicault\nplay. Within half an hour is Cambridge, where a delightful domestic\nlife--simple, self-respectful, cordial, and affectionate--is seen in an\nadmirable aspect. All New England is primitive and puritanical. All\nabout and around it is a puddle of mixed human mud, with no such quality\nin it. Perhaps I may in time sift out some tolerably intelligible whole,\nbut I certainly have not done so yet. It is a good sign, may be, that it\nall seems immensely more difficult to understand than it was when I was\nhere before.\n\nFelton left two daughters. I have only seen the eldest, a very sensible,\nfrank, pleasant girl of eight-and-twenty, perhaps, rather like him in\nthe face. A striking-looking daughter of Hawthorn's (who is also dead)\ncame into my room last night. The day has slipped on to three o'clock,\nand I must get up \"Dombey\" for to-night. Hence this sudden break off.\nBest love to Mamie, and to Katie and Charley Collins.",

Wilkie Collins.]\n\n               WESTMINSTER HOTEL, NEW YORK, _Sunday, Jan. 12th, 1868._\n\nMY DEAR WILKIE,\n\nFirst, of the play.[21] I am truly delighted to learn that it made so\ngreat a success, and I hope I may yet see it on the Adelphi boards. You\nhave had a world of trouble and work with it, but I hope will be repaid\nin some degree by the pleasure of a triumph. Even for the alteration at\nthe end of the fourth act (of which you tell me in your letter received\nyesterday), I was fully prepared, for I COULD NOT see the original\neffect in the reading of the play, and COULD NOT make it go. I agree\nwith Webster in thinking it best that Obenreizer should die on the\nstage; but no doubt that point is disposed of. In reading the play\nbefore the representation, I felt that it was too long, and that there\nwas a good deal of unnecessary explanation. Those points are, no doubt,\ndisposed of too by this time.\n\nWe shall do nothing with it on this side. Pirates are producing their\nown wretched versions in all directions, thus (as Wills would say)\nanticipating and glutting \"the market.\" I registered one play as the\nproperty of Ticknor and Fields, American citizens. But, besides that the\nlaw on the point is extremely doubtful, the manager of the Museum\nTheatre, Boston, instantly announced his version. (You may suppose what\nit is and how it is done, when I tell you that it was playing within ten\ndays of the arrival out of the Christmas number.) Thereupon, Ticknor and\nFields gave him notice that he mustn't play it. Unto which he replied,\nthat he meant to play it and would play it. Of course he knew very well\nthat if an injunction were applied for against him, there would be an\nimmediate howl against my persecution of an innocent, and he played it.\nThen the noble host of pirates rushed in, and it is being done, in some\nmangled form or other, everywhere.\n\nIt touches me to read what you write of your poor mother. But, of\ncourse, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do give her my love, and\ntell her that I asked you about her.\n\nI am going on here at the same great rate, but am always counting the\ndays that lie between me and home. I got through the first fourth of my\nreadings on Friday, January 3rd. I leave for two readings at\nPhiladelphia this evening.\n\nBeing at Boston last Sunday, I took it into my head to go over the\nmedical school, and survey the holes and corners in which that\nextraordinary murder was done by Webster. There was the\nfurnace--stinking horribly, as if the dismembered pieces were still\ninside it--and there are all the grim spouts, and sinks, and chemical\nappliances, and what not. At dinner, afterwards, Longfellow told me a\nterrific story. He dined with Webster within a year of the murder, one\nof a party of ten or twelve. As they sat at their wine, Webster suddenly\nordered the lights to be turned out, and a bowl of some burning mineral\nto be placed on the table, that the guests might see how ghostly it made\nthem look. As each man stared at all the rest in the weird light, all\nwere horrified to see Webster _with a rope round his neck_, holding it\nup, over the bowl, with his head jerked on one side, and his tongue\nlolled out, representing a man being hanged!\n\nPoking into his life and character, I find (what I would have staked my\nhead upon) that he was always a cruel man.\n\nSo no more at present from,\n\n        My dear Wilkie, yours ever affectionately.",

I have scarcely a word of news. My cold steadily refuses to leave\nme; but otherwise I am as right as one can hope to be under this heavy\nwork. My New York readings are over (except four farewell nights in\nApril), and I look forward to the relief of being out of my hardest\nhall. Last Friday night, though it was only \"Nickleby\" and \"Boots,\" I\nwas again dead beat at the end, and was once more laid upon a sofa. But\nthe faintness went off after a little while. We have now cold, bright,\nfrosty weather, without snow--the best weather for me.\n\nHaving been in great trepidation about the play, I am correspondingly\nelated by the belief that it really _is_ a success. No doubt the\nunnecessary explanations will have been taken out, and the flatness of\nthe last act fetched up. At some points I could have done wonders to it,\nin the way of screwing it up sharply and picturesquely, if I could have\nrehearsed it. Your account of the first night interested me immensely,\nbut I was afraid to open the letter until Dolby rushed in with the\nopened _Times_.\n\nOn Wednesday I come back here for my four church readings at Brooklyn.\nEach evening an enormous ferryboat will convey me and my state carriage\n(not to mention half-a-dozen waggons, and any number of people, and a\nfew score of horses) across the river, and will bring me back again. The\nsale of tickets there was an amazing scene. The noble army of\nspeculators are now furnished (this is literally true, and I am quite\nserious), each man with a straw mattress, a little bag of bread and\nmeat, two blankets, and a bottle of whisky. With this outfit _they lie\ndown in line on the pavement_ the whole night before the tickets are\nsold, generally taking up their position at about ten. It being severely\ncold at Brooklyn, they made an immense bonfire in the street--a narrow\nstreet of wooden houses!--which the police turned out to extinguish. A\ngeneral fight then took place, out of which the people farthest off in\nthe line rushed bleeding when they saw a chance of displacing others\nnear the door, and put their mattresses in those places, and then held\non by the iron rails. At eight in the morning Dolby appeared with the\ntickets in a portmanteau. He was immediately saluted with a roar of\n\"Halloa, Dolby! So Charley has let you have the carriage, has he, Dolby!\nHow is he, Dolby! Don't drop the tickets, Dolby! Look alive, Dolby!\"\netc. etc. etc., in the midst of which he proceeded to business, and\nconcluded (as usual) by giving universal dissatisfaction.\n\nHe is now going off upon a little journey \"to look over the ground and\ncut back again.\" This little journey (to Chicago) is fifteen hundred\nmiles on end, by railway, and back again!\n\nWe have an excellent gasman, who is well up to that department. We have\nenlarged the large staff by another clerk, yet even now the preparation\nof such an immense number of new tickets constantly, and the keeping and\nchecking of the accounts, keep them hard at it. And they get so oddly\ndivided! Kelly is at Philadelphia, another man at Baltimore, two others\nare stamping tickets at the top of this house, another is cruising over\nNew England, and Osgood will come on duty to-morrow (when Dolby starts\noff) to pick me up after the reading, and take me to the hotel, and\nmount guard over me, and bring me back here. You see that even such\nwretched domesticity as Dolby and self by a fireside is broken up under\nthese conditions.\n\nDolby has been twice poisoned, and Osgood once. Morgan's sharpness has\ndiscovered the cause. When the snow is deep upon the ground, and the\npartridges cannot get their usual food, they eat something (I don't know\nwhat, if anybody does) which does not poison _them_, but which poisons\nthe people who eat them. The symptoms, which last some twelve hours, are\nviolent sickness, cold perspiration, and the formation of some\ndetestable mucus in the stomach. You may infer that partridges have been\nbanished from our bill of fare. The appearance of our sufferers was\nlamentable in the extreme.\n\nDid I tell you that the severity of the weather, and the heat of the\nintolerable furnaces, dry the hair and break the nails of strangers?\nThere is not a complete nail in the whole British suite, and my hair\ncracks again when I brush it. (I am losing my hair with great rapidity,\nand what I don't lose is getting very grey.)\n\nThe _Cuba_ will bring this. She has a jolly new captain--Moody, of the\n_Java_--and her people rushed into the reading, the other night,\ncaptain-headed, as if I were their peculiar property. Please God I shall\ncome home in her, in my old cabin; leaving here on the 22nd of April,\nand finishing my eighty-fourth reading on the previous night! It is\nlikely enough that I shall read and go straight on board.\n\nI think this is all my poor stock of intelligence. By-the-bye, on the\nlast Sunday in the old year, I lost my old year's pocket-book, \"which,\"\nas Mr. Pepys would add, \"do trouble me mightily.\" Give me Katie's new\naddress; I haven't got it.",

This is one of the immense American hotels (it is called\nthe Continental); but I find myself just as quiet here as elsewhere.\nEverything is very good indeed, the waiter is German, and the greater\npart of the house servants seem to be coloured people. The town is very\nclean, and the day as blue and bright as a fine Italian day. But it\nfreezes very hard. All the tickets being sold here for six nights (three\nvisits of two nights each), the suite complain of want of excitement\nalready, having been here ten hours! Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams, with\na couple of servants, and a pretty little child-daughter, were in the\ntrain each night, and I talked with them a good deal. They are reported\nto have made an enormous fortune by acting among the Californian\ngold-diggers. My cold is no better, for the cars are so intolerably hot,\nthat I was often obliged to go and stand upon the break outside, and\nthen the frosty air was biting indeed. The great man of this place is\none Mr. Childs, a newspaper proprietor, and he is so exactly like Mr.\nEsse in all conceivable respects except being an inch or so taller, that\nI was quite confounded when I saw him waiting for me at the station\n(always called depot here) with his carriage. During the last two or\nthree days, Dolby and I have been making up accounts, which are\nexcellently kept by Mr. Osgood, and I find them amazing, quite, in their\nresults.\n\nI was very much interested in the home accounts of Christmas Day. I\nthink I have already mentioned that we were in very low spirits on that\nday. I began to be unwell with my cold that morning, and a long day's\ntravel did not mend the matter. We scarcely spoke (except when we ate\nour lunch), and sat dolefully staring out of window. I had a few\naffectionate words from Chorley, dated from my room, on Christmas\nmorning, and will write him, probably by this mail, a brief\nacknowledgment. I find it necessary (so oppressed am I with this\nAmerican catarrh, as they call it) to dine at three o'clock instead of\nfour, that I may have more time to get voice, so that the days are cut\nshort, and letter-writing is not easy.\n\nMy best love to Katie, and to Charley, and to our Charley, and to all\nfriends.

I had previously heard of the play, and had _The Times_.\nIt was a great relief and delight to me, for I had no confidence in its\nsuccess; being reduced to the confines of despair by its length. If I\ncould have rehearsed it, I should have taken the best part of an hour\nout of it. Fechter must be very fine, and I should greatly like to see\nhim play the part.\n\nI have not been very well generally, and am oppressed (and I begin to\nthink that I probably shall be until I leave) by a true American cold,\nwhich I hope, for the comfort of human nature, may be peculiar to only\none of the four quarters of the world. The work, too, is very severe.\nBut I am going on at the same tremendous rate everywhere. The staff,\ntoo, has had to be enlarged. Dolby was at Baltimore yesterday, is at\nWashington to-day, and will come back in the night, and start away again\non Friday. We find it absolutely necessary for him to go on ahead. We\nhave not printed or posted a single bill here, and have just sold ninety\npounds' worth of paper we had got ready for bills. In such a rush a\nshort newspaper advertisement is all we want. \"Doctor Marigold\" made a\ngreat hit here, and is looked forward to at Boston with especial\ninterest. I go to Boston for another fortnight, on end, the 24th of\nFebruary. The railway journeys distress me greatly. I get out into the\nopen air (upon the break), and it snows and blows, and the train bumps,\nand the steam flies at me, until I am driven in again.\n\nI have finished here (except four farewell nights in April), and begin\nfour nights at Brooklyn, on the opposite side of the river, to-night;\nand thus oscillate between Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and\nthen cut into New England, and so work my way back to Boston for a\nfortnight, after which come Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit and Cleveland,\nand Buffalo, and then Philadelphia, Boston, and New York farewells. I\nwill not pass my original bound of eighty-four readings in all. My mind\nwas made up as to that long ago. It will be quite enough. Chicago is\nsome fifteen hundred miles from here. What with travelling, and getting\nready for reading, and reading, the days are pretty fully occupied. Not\nthe less so because I rest very indifferently at night.\n\nThe people are exceedingly kind and considerate, and desire to be most\nhospitable besides. But I cannot accept hospitality, and never go out,\nexcept at Boston, or I should not be fit for the labour. If Dolby holds\nout well to the last it will be a triumph, for he has to see everybody,\ndrink with everybody, sell all the tickets, take all the blame, and go\nbeforehand to all the places on the list. I shall not see him after\nto-night for ten days or a fortnight, and he will be perpetually on the\nroad during the interval. When he leaves me, Osgood, a partner in\nTicknor and Fields' publishing firm, mounts guard over me, and has to go\ninto the hall from the platform door every night, and see how the public\nare seating themselves. It is very odd to see how hard he finds it to\nlook a couple of thousand people in the face, on which head, by-the-bye,\nI notice the papers to take \"Mr. Dickens's extraordinary composure\"\n(their great phrase) rather ill, and on the whole to imply that it would\nbe taken as a suitable compliment if I would stagger on to the platform\nand instantly drop, overpowered by the spectacle before me.\n\nDinner is announced (by Scott, with a stiff neck and a sore throat), and\nI must break off with love to Bessie and the incipient Wenerableses. You\nwill be glad to hear of your distinguished parent that Philadelphia has\ndiscovered that \"he is not like the descriptions we have read of him at\nthe little red desk. He is not at all foppish in appearance. He wears a\nheavy moustache and a Vandyke beard, and looks like a well-to-do\nPhiladelphian gentleman.\"\n\n                      Ever, my dear Charley, your affectionate Father.\n\nP.S.--Your paper is remarkably good.

I rarely take any breakfast but an egg and a cup of tea, not even\ntoast or bread-and-butter.

The other night, Scott (with a\nportmanteau across his knees and a wideawake hat low down upon his nose)\ntold me that he had presented himself for admission in the circus (as\ngood as Franconi's, by-the-bye), and had been refused. \"The only\ntheayter,\" he said in a melancholy way, \"as I was ever in my life turned\nfrom the door of.\" Says Kelly: \"There must have been some mistake,\nScott, because George and me went, and we said, 'Mr. Dickens's staff,'\nand they passed us to the best seats in the house.

So I will begin in this present\nwriting with reference to her sad position. I think it will be best for\nyou to be guided by an exact knowledge of her _wants_. Try to ascertain\nfrom herself what means she has, whether her sick husband gets what he\nought to have, whether she is pinched in the articles of necessary\nclothing, bedding, or the like of that; add to this intelligence your\nown observation of the state of things about her, and supply what she\nmost wants, and help her where you find the greatest need. The question,\nin the case of so old and faithful a servant, is not one of so much or\nso little money on my side, but how _most efficiently_ to ease her mind\nand help _her_. To do this at once kindly and sensibly is the only\nconsideration by which you have to be guided. Take _carte blanche_ from\nme for all the rest.\n\nMy Washington week is the first week in February, beginning on Monday,\n3rd. The tickets are sold, and the President is coming, and the chief\nmembers of the Cabinet, and the leaders of parties, and so forth, are\ncoming; and, as the Holly Tree Boots says: \"That's where it is, don't\nyou see!\"\n\nIn my Washington doubts I recalled Dolby for conference, and he joined\nme yesterday afternoon, and we have been in great discussion ever since\non the possibility of giving up the Far West, and avoiding such immense\ndistances and fatigues as would be involved in travelling to Chicago and\nCincinnati. We have sketched another tour for the last half of March,\nwhich would be infinitely easier for me, though on the other hand less\nprofitable, the places and the halls being smaller. The worst of it is,\nthat everybody one advises with has a monomania respecting Chicago.\n\"Good heaven, sir,\" the great Philadelphian authority said to me this\nmorning, \"if you don't read in Chicago, the people will go into fits.\"\nIn reference to fatigue, I answered: \"Well, I would rather they went\ninto fits than I did.\" But he didn't seem to see it at all. ---- alone\nconstantly writes me: \"Don't go to the West; you can get what you want\nso much more easily.\" How we shall finally decide, I don't yet know. My\nBrooklyn church has been an immense success, and I found its minister\nwas a bachelor, a clever, unparsonic, and straightforward man, and a man\nwith a good knowledge of art into the bargain.\n\nWe are not a bit too soon here, for the whole country is beginning to be\nstirred and shaken by the presidential election, and trade is\nexceedingly depressed, and will be more so. Fanny Kemble lives near this\nplace, but had gone away a day before my first visit here. _She_ is\ngoing to read in February or March. Du Chaillu has been lecturing out\nWest about the gorilla, and has been to see me; I saw the Cunard steamer\n_Persia_ out in the stream, yesterday, beautifully smart, her flags\nflying, all her steam up, and she only waiting for her mails to slip\naway. She gave me a horrible touch of home-sickness.\n\nWhen the 1st of March arrives, and I can say \"next month,\" I shall begin\nto grow brighter. A fortnight's reading in Boston, too (last week of\nFebruary and first week of March), will help me on gaily, I hope (the\nwork so far off tells). It is impossible for the people to be more\naffectionately attached to a third, I really believe, than Fields and\nhis wife are to me; and they are a landmark in the prospect.\n\nDolby sends kindest regards, and wishes it to be known that he has not\nbeen bullied lately.

I read here in a\ncharming little opera-house built by a society of Germans, quite a\ndelightful place for the purpose. I stand on the stage, with a drop\ncurtain down, and my screen before it. The whole scene is very pretty\nand complete, and the audience have a \"ring\" in them that sounds in the\near. I go from here to Philadelphia to read to-morrow night and Friday,\ncome through here again on Saturday on my way to Washington, come back\nhere on Saturday week for two finishing nights, then go to Philadelphia\nfor two farewells, and so turn my back on the southern part of the\ncountry. Distances and travelling have obliged us to reduce the list of\nreadings by two, leaving eighty-two in all. Of course we afterwards\ndiscovered that we had finally settled the list on a Friday! I shall be\nhalfway through it at Washington, of course, on a Friday also, and my\nbirthday!\n\nDolby and Osgood, who do the most ridiculous things to keep me in\nspirits (I am often very heavy, and rarely sleep much), have decided to\nhave a walking-match at Boston, on Saturday, February 29th. Beginning\nthis design in joke, they have become tremendously in earnest, and Dolby\nhas actually sent home (much to his opponent's terror) for a pair of\nseamless socks to walk in. Our men are hugely excited on the subject,\nand continually make bets on \"the men.\" Fields and I are to walk out six\nmiles, and \"the men\" are to turn and walk round us. Neither of them has\nthe least idea what twelve miles at a pace is. Being requested by both\nto give them \"a breather\" yesterday, I gave them a stiff one of five\nmiles over a bad road in the snow, half the distance uphill. I took them\nat a pace of four miles and a half an hour, and you never beheld such\nobjects as they were when we got back; both smoking like factories, and\nboth obliged to change everything before they could come to dinner. They\nhave the absurdest ideas of what are tests of walking power, and\ncontinually get up in the maddest manner and see _how high they can\nkick_ the wall! The wainscot here, in one place, is scored all over with\ntheir pencil-marks. To see them doing this--Dolby, a big man, and\nOsgood, a very little one, is ridiculous beyond description.\n\n\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, _Same Night._\n\nWe came on here through a snowstorm all the way, but up to time. Fanny\nKemble (who begins to read shortly) is coming to \"Marigold\" and \"Trial\"\nto-morrow night. I have written her a note, telling her that if it will\nat all assist _her_ movements to know _mine_, my list is at her\nservice. Probably I shall see her to-morrow. Tell Mamie (to whom I will\nwrite next), with my love, that I found her letter of the 10th of this\nmonth awaiting me here. The _Siberia_ that brought it is a new Cunarder,\nand made an unusually slow passage out. Probably because it would be\ndangerous to work new machinery too fast on the Atlantic.\n\n\n                                                     _Thursday, 30th._\n\nMy cold still sticks to me. The heat of the railway cars and their\nunventilated condition invariably brings it back when I think it going.\nThis morning my head is as stuffed and heavy as ever! A superb sledge\nand four horses have been offered me for a ride, but I am afraid to take\nit, lest I should make the \"true American catarrh\" worse, and should get\nhoarse. So I am going to give Osgood another \"breather\" on foot instead.\n\nThe communication with New York is not interrupted, so we consider the\nzealous Dolby all right. You may imagine what his work is, when you hear\nthat he goes three times to every place we visit. Firstly, to look at\nthe hall, arrange the numberings, and make five hundred acquaintances,\nwhom he immediately calls by their christian-names; secondly, to sell\nthe tickets--a very nice business, requiring great tact and temper;\nthirdly, with me.

Next week, at\nWashington, I shall, please God, have got through half my readings. The\nremaining half are all arranged, and they will carry me into the third\nweek of April. It is very hard work, but it is brilliantly paid. The\nchanges that I find in the country generally (this place is the least\nchanged of any I have yet seen) exceed my utmost expectations. I had\nbeen in New York a couple of days before I began to recognise it at all;\nand the handsomest part of Boston was a black swamp when I saw it\nfive-and-twenty years ago. Considerable advances, too, have been made\nsocially. Strange to say, the railways and railway arrangements (both\nexceedingly defective) seem to have stood still while all other things\nhave been moving.\n\nOne of the most comical spectacles I have ever seen in my life was\n\"church,\" with a heavy sea on, in the saloon of the Cunard steamer\ncoming out. The officiating minister, an extremely modest young man, was\nbrought in between two big stewards, exactly as if he were coming up to\nthe scratch in a prize-fight. The ship was rolling and pitching so, that\nthe two big stewards had to stop and watch their opportunity of making a\ndart at the reading-desk with their reverend charge, during which pause\nhe held on, now by one steward and now by the other, with the feeblest\nexpression of countenance and no legs whatever. At length they made a\ndart at the wrong moment, and one steward was immediately beheld alone\nin the extreme perspective, while the other and the reverend gentleman\n_held on by the mast_ in the middle of the saloon--which the latter\nembraced with both arms, as if it were his wife. All this time the\ncongregation was breaking up into sects and sliding away; every sect (as\nin nature) pounding the other sect. And when at last the reverend\ngentleman had been tumbled into his place, the desk (a loose one, put\nupon the dining-table) deserted from the church bodily, and went over to\nthe purser. The scene was so extraordinarily ridiculous, and was made so\nmuch more so by the exemplary gravity of all concerned in it, that I was\nobliged to leave before the service began.\n\nThis is one of the places where Butler carried it with so high a hand in\nthe war, and where the ladies used to spit when they passed a Northern\nsoldier. It still wears, I fancy, a look of sullen remembrance. (The\nladies are remarkably handsome, with an Eastern look upon them, dress\nwith a strong sense of colour, and make a brilliant audience.) The ghost\nof slavery haunts the houses; and the old, untidy, incapable, lounging,\nshambling black serves you as a free man. Free of course he ought to be;\nbut the stupendous absurdity of making him a voter glares out of every\nroll of his eye, stretch of his mouth, and bump of his head. I have a\nstrong impression that the race must fade out of the States very fast.\nIt never can hold its own against a striving, restless, shifty people.\nIn the penitentiary here, the other day, in a room full of all blacks\n(too dull to be taught any of the work in hand), was one young brooding\nfellow, very like a black rhinoceros. He sat glowering at life, as if it\nwere just endurable at dinner time, until four of his fellows began to\nsing, most unmelodiously, a part song. He then set up a dismal howl, and\npounded his face on a form. I took him to have been rendered quite\ndesperate by having learnt anything. I send my kind regard to Mrs.\nCartwright, and sincerely hope that she and you have no new family\ndistresses or anxieties. My standing address is the Westminster Hotel,\nIrving Place, New York City. And I am always, my dear Cartwright,\n\n                                                      Cordially yours.",

The hall being small, the\nprices were raised to three dollars each ticket. The audience was a\nsuperior one, composed of the foremost public men and their families. At\nthe end of the \"Carol\" they gave a great break out, and applauded, I\nreally believe, for five minutes. You would suppose them to be\nManchester shillings instead of Washington half-sovereigns. Immense\nenthusiasm.\n\nA devoted adherent in this place (an Englishman) had represented to\nDolby that if I were taken to an hotel here it would be impossible to\nsecure me a minute's rest, and he undertook to get one Wheleker, a\nGerman, who keeps a little V\u00e9rey's, to furnish his private dining-rooms\nfor the illustrious traveller's reception. Accordingly here we are, on\nthe first and second floor of a small house, with no one else in it but\nour people, a French waiter, and a very good French cuisine. Perfectly\nprivate, in the city of all the world (I should say) where the hotels\nare intolerable, and privacy the least possible, and quite comfortable.\n\"Wheleker's Restaurant\" is our rather undignified address for the\npresent week.\n\nI dined (against my rules) with Charles Sumner on Sunday, he having been\nan old friend of mine. Mr. Secretary Staunton (War Minister) was there.\nHe is a man of a very remarkable memory, and famous for his\nacquaintance with the minutest details of my books. Give him any passage\nanywhere, and he will instantly cap it and go on with the context. He\nwas commander-in-chief of all the Northern forces concentrated here, and\nnever went to sleep at night without first reading something from my\nbooks, which were always with him. I put him through a pretty severe\nexamination, but he was better up than I was.\n\nThe gas was very defective indeed last night, and I began with a small\nspeech, to the effect that I must trust to the brightness of their faces\nfor the illumination of mine; this was taken greatly. In the \"Carol,\" a\nmost ridiculous incident occurred all of a sudden. I saw a dog look out\nfrom among the seats into the centre aisle, and look very intently at\nme. The general attention being fixed on me, I don't think anybody saw\nthe dog; but I felt so sure of his turning up again and barking, that I\nkept my eye wandering about in search of him. He was a very comic dog,\nand it was well for me that I was reading a very comic part of the book.\nBut when he bounced out into the centre aisle again, in an entirely new\nplace (still looking intently at me) and tried the effect of a bark upon\nmy proceedings, I was seized with such a paroxysm of laughter, that it\ncommunicated itself to the audience, and we roared at one another loud\nand long.\n\nThe President has sent to me twice, and I am going to see him to-morrow.\nHe has a whole row for his family every night. Dolby rejoined his chief\nyesterday morning, and will probably remain in the august presence until\nSunday night. He and Osgood, \"training for the match,\" are ludicrous\nbeyond belief. I saw them just now coming up a street, each trying to\npass the other, and immediately fled. Since I have been writing this,\nthey have burst in at the door and sat down on the floor to blow. Dolby\nis now writing at a neighbouring table, with his bald head smoking as if\nhe were on fire. Kelly (his great adherent) asked me, when he was last\naway, whether it was quite fair that I should take Mr. Osgood out for\n\"breathers\" when Mr. Dolby had no such advantage. I begin to expect that\nhalf Boston will turn out on the 29th to see the match. In which case it\nwill be unspeakably droll.",

He had sent a\ngentleman to me, most courteously begging me to make my own appointment,\nand I did so. A man of very remarkable appearance indeed, of tremendous\nfirmness of purpose.

It is now\nin my throat, and slightly on my chest. It occasions me great\ndiscomfort, and you would suppose, seeing me in the morning, that I\ncould not possibly read at night. But I have always come up to the\nscratch, have not yet missed one night, and have gradually got used to\nthat. I had got much the better of it; but the dressing-room at the hall\nhere is singularly cold and draughty, and so I have slid back again.\n\nThe papers here having written about this being my birthday, the most\nexquisite flowers came pouring in at breakfast time from all sorts of\npeople. The room is covered with them, made up into beautiful bouquets,\nand arranged in all manner of green baskets. Probably I shall find\nplenty more at the hall to-night. This is considered the dullest and\nmost apathetic place in America. _My_ audiences have been superb.\n\nI mentioned the dog on the first night here. Next night I thought I\nheard (in \"Copperfield\") a suddenly suppressed bark. It happened in this\nwise: Osgood, standing just within the door, felt his leg touched, and\nlooking down beheld the dog staring intently at me, and evidently just\nabout to bark. In a transport of presence of mind and fury, he instantly\ncaught him up in both hands and threw him over his own head out into the\nentry, where the check-takers received him like a game at ball. Last\nnight he came again _with another dog_; but our people were so sharply\non the look-out for him that he didn't get in. He had evidently promised\nto pass the other dog free.",

I couldn't help laughing at myself on my birthday at Washington.\nIt was observed as much as though I were a little boy. Flowers and\ngarlands (of the most exquisite kind) bloomed all over the room; letters\nradiant with good wishes poured in; a shirt pin, a handsome silver\ntravelling bottle, a set of gold shirt studs, and a set of gold sleeve\nlinks were on the dinner-table. After \"Boots,\" at night, the whole\naudience rose and remained (Secretaries of State, President's family,\nJudges of Supreme Court, and so forth) standing and cheering until I\nwent back to the table and made them a little speech. On the same\naugust day of the year I was received by the President, a man with a\nvery remarkable and determined face. Each of us looked at each other\nvery hard, and each of us managed the interview (I think) to the\nsatisfaction of the other. In the outer room was sitting a certain\nsunburnt General Blair, with many evidences of the war upon him. He got\nup to shake hands with me, and then I found he had been out in the\nprairie with me five-and-twenty years ago. That afternoon my \"catarrh\"\nwas in such a state that Charles Sumner, coming in at five o'clock and\nfinding me covered with mustard poultice, and apparently voiceless,\nturned to Dolby and said: \"Surely, Mr. Dolby, it is impossible that he\ncan read to-night.\" Says Dolby: \"Sir, I have told the dear Chief so four\ntimes to-day, and I have been very anxious. But you have no idea how he\nwill change when he gets to the little table.\" After five minutes of the\nlittle table, I was not (for the time) even hoarse.

To re-cover, with red leather, all the dining-room chairs.\n\n2. To ditto, with green leather, all the library chairs and the couch.\n\n3.

Will you and your aunt carefully examine\nboth (calling in Homan too, if necessary), _and report to me_?\n\nIt would seem that \"No Thoroughfare\" has really developed as a drama\ninto an amazing success. I begin to think that I shall see it. Dolby is\naway this morning, to conquer or die in a terrific struggle with the\nMayor of Newhaven (where I am to read next week), who has assailed him\non a charge of false play in selling tickets.

There are some things to be considered, however,\nwhich you have hardly taken into account. The first thing to be avoided\nis, the slightest appearance of patronage (one of the curses of\nEngland). The second thing to be avoided is, the deprival of the men of\ntheir just right to manage their own affairs. I would rather have no\nclub at all, than have either of these great mistakes made. The way out\nof them is this: Call the men together, and explain to them that the\nclub might be larger, richer, and better. Say that you think that more\nof the neighbouring gentlemen could be got to be playing members. That\nyou submit to them that it would be better to have a captain who could\ncorrespond with them, and talk to them, and in some sort manage them;\nand that, being perfectly acquainted with the game, and having long\nplayed it at a great public school, you propose yourself as captain, for\nthe foregoing reasons. That you propose to them to make the subscription\nof the gentlemen members at least double that of the working men, for no\nother reason than that the gentlemen can afford it better; but that both\nclasses of members shall have exactly the same right of voting equally\nin all that concerns the club. Say that you have consulted me upon the\nmatter, and that I am of these opinions, and am ready to become chairman\nof the club, and to preside at their meetings, and to overlook its\nbusiness affairs, and to give it five pounds a year, payable at the\ncommencement of each season. Then, having brought them to this point,\ndraw up the club's rules and regulations, amending them where they want\namendment.\n\nDiscreetly done, I see no difficulty in this. But it can only be\nhonourably and hopefully done by having the men together. And I would\nnot have them at The Falstaff, but in the hall or dining-room--the\nservants' hall, an excellent place. Whatever you do, let the men ratify;\nand let them feel their little importance, and at once perceive how much\nbetter the business begins to be done.\n\nI am very glad to hear of the success of your reading, and still more\nglad that you went at it in downright earnest. I should never have made\nmy success in life if I had been shy of taking pains, or if I had not\nbestowed upon the least thing I have ever undertaken exactly the same\nattention and care that I have bestowed upon the greatest. Do everything\nat your best. It was but this last year that I set to and learned every\nword of my readings; and from ten years ago to last night, I have never\nread to an audience but I have watched for an opportunity of striking\nout something better somewhere. Look at such of my manuscripts as are\nin the library at Gad's, and think of the patient hours devoted year\nafter year to single lines.\n\n                                   \n\nThe weather is very severe here, and the work is very hard. Dolby,\nhaving been violently pitched into by the Mayor of Newhaven (a town at\nwhich I am to read next week), has gone bodily this morning with defiant\nwritten instructions from me to inform the said mayor that, if he fail\nto make out his case, he (Dolby) is to return all the money taken, and\nto tell him that I will not set foot in his jurisdiction; whereupon the\nNewhaven people will probably fall upon the mayor in his turn, and lead\nhim a pleasant life.\n\n                        Ever, my dear Harry, your affectionate Father.",

I\nhave a strong suspicion that one of our men (who sold there) has been\nspeculating all this while, and that he must have put front seats in his\npockets, and sold back ones. He denies what the mayor charges, but the\nmayor holds on grimly. Dolby set off from Baltimore as soon as we found\nout what was amiss, to examine and report; but some new feature of\ndifficulty must have come out, for this morning he telegraphs from New\nYork (where he had to sleep last night on his way to Newhaven), that he\nis coming back for further consultation with the Chief. It will\ncertainly hurt us, and will of course be distorted by the papers into\nall manner of shapes. My suspicion _may not_ be correct, but I have an\ninstinctive belief that it is. We shall probably have the old New York\nrow (and loss) over again, unless I can catch this mayor tripping in an\nassertion.\n\nIn this very place, we are half-distracted by the speculators. They have\nbeen holding out for such high prices, that the public have held out\ntoo; and now (frightened at what they have done) the speculators are\ntrying to sell their worst seats at half the cost price, so that we are\nin the ridiculous situation of having sold the room out, and yet not\nknowing what empty seats there may be. _We_ could sell at our box-office\nto any extent; but _we_ can't buy back of the speculators, because we\ninformed the public that all the tickets were gone. And if we bought\n_under_ our own price and _sold_ at our own price, we should at once be\nin treaty with the speculators, and should be making money by it! Dolby,\nthe much bullied, will come back here presently, half bereft of his\nsenses; and I should be half bereft of mine, if the situation were not\ncomically disagreeable.\n\nNothing will induce the people to believe in the farewells. At Baltimore\non Tuesday night (a very brilliant night indeed), they asked as they\ncame out: \"When will Mr. Dickens read here again?\" \"Never.\" \"Nonsense!\nNot come back, after such houses as these? Come. Say when he'll read\nagain.\" Just the same here. We could as soon persuade them that I am the\nPresident, as that I am going to read here, for the last time, to-morrow\nnight.\n\nThere is a child of the Barney Williams's in this house--a little\ngirl--to whom I presented a black doll when I was here last. I have seen\nher eye at the keyhole since I began writing this, and I think she and\nthe doll are outside still. \"When you sent it up to me by the coloured\nboy,\" she said after receiving it (coloured boy is the term for black\nwaiter), \"I gave such a cream that ma came running in and creamed too,\n'cos she fort I'd hurt myself. But I creamed a cream of joy.\" _She_ had\na friend to play with her that day, and brought the friend with her, to\nmy infinite confusion. A friend all stockings, and much too tall, who\nsat on the sofa very far back, with her stockings sticking stiffly out\nin front of her, and glared at me and never spake word.

I have sent you a telegram\n(addressed to the theatre) this morning, and I write this by the\nearliest return mail.\n\nMy dear fellow, consider yourself my representative. Whatever you do, or\ndesire to do, about the play, I fully authorise beforehand. Tell\nWebster, with my regard, that I think his proposal honest and fair; that\nI think it, in a word, like himself; and that I have perfect confidence\nin his good faith and liberality.\n\nAs to making money of the play in the United States here, Boucicault has\nfilled Wilkie's head with golden dreams that have _nothing_ in them. He\nmakes no account of the fact that, wherever I go, the theatres (with my\nname in big letters) instantly begin playing versions of my books, and\nthat the moment the Christmas number came over here they pirated it and\nplayed \"No Thoroughfare.\" Now, I have enquired into the law, and am\nextremely doubtful whether I _could_ have prevented this. Why should\nthey pay for the piece as you act it, when they have no actors, and when\nall they want is my name, and they can get that for nothing?\n\nWilkie has uniformly written of you enthusiastically. In a letter I had\nfrom him, dated the 10th of January, he described your conception and\nexecution of the part in the most glowing terms. \"Here Fechter is\nmagnificent.\" \"Here his superb playing brings the house down.\" \"I should\ncall even his exit in the last act one of the subtlest and finest things\nhe does in the piece.\" \"You can hardly imagine what he gets out of the\npart, or what he makes of his passionate love for Marguerite.\" These\nexpressions, and many others like them, crowded his letter.\n\nI never did so want to see a character played on the stage as I want to\nsee you play Obenreizer. As the play was going when I last heard of it,\nI have some hopes that I MAY see it yet. Please God, your Adelphi\ndressing-room will be irradiated with the noble presence of \"Never\nWrong\" (if you are acting), about the evening of Monday, the 4th of May!\n\nI am doing enormous business. It is a wearying life, away from all I\nlove, but I hope that the time will soon begin to spin away. Among the\nmany changes that I find here is the comfortable change that the people\nare in general extremely considerate, and very observant of my privacy.\nEven in this place, I am really almost as much my own master as if I\nwere in an English country town. Generally, they are very good audiences\nindeed. They do not (I think) perceive touches of art to _be_ art; but\nthey are responsive to the broad results of such touches. \"Doctor\nMarigold\" is a great favourite, and they laugh so unrestrainedly at \"The\nTrial\" from \"Pickwick\" (which you never heard), that it has grown about\nhalf as long again as it used to be.\n\nIf I could send you a \"brandy cocktail\" by post I would. It is a highly\nmeritorious dram, which I hope to present to you at Gad's. My New York\nlandlord made me a \"Rocky Mountain sneezer,\" which appeared to me to be\ncompounded of all the spirits ever heard of in the world, with bitters,\nlemon, sugar, and snow. You can only make a true \"sneezer\" when the snow\nis lying on the ground.\n\nThere, my dear boy, my paper is out, and I am going to read\n\"Copperfield.\" Count always on my fidelity and true attachment, and look\nout, as I have already said, for a distinguished visitor about Monday,\nthe 4th of May.\n\n                    Ever, my dear Fechter,\n                                 Your cordial and affectionate Friend.",

I have very little news to give you in return for your budget.\nThe walking-match is to come off on Saturday, and Fields and I went over\nthe ground yesterday to measure the miles. We went at a tremendous pace.\nThe condition of the ground is something indescribable, from half-melted\nsnow, running water, and sheets and blocks of ice. The two performers\nhave not the faintest notion of the weight of the task they have\nundertaken. I give a dinner afterwards, and have just now been settling\nthe bill of fare and selecting the wines.\n\nIn the first excitement of the presidential impeachment, our houses\ninstantly went down. After carefully considering the subject, I decided\nto take advantage of the fact that next week's four readings here have\nnot yet been announced, and to abolish them altogether. Nothing in this\ncountry lasts long, and I think the public may be heartily tired of the\nPresident's name by the 9th of March, when I read at a considerable\ndistance from here. So behold me with a whole week's holiday in view!\nThe Boston audiences have come to regard the readings and the reader as\ntheir peculiar property; and you would be at once amused and pleased if\nyou could see the curious way in which they seem to plume themselves on\nboth. They have taken to applauding too whenever they laugh or cry, and\nthe result is very inspiriting. I shall remain here until Saturday, the\n7th, but shall not read here, after to-morrow night, until the 1st of\nApril, when I begin my Boston farewells, six in number.\n\n\n                                                       _Friday, 28th._\n\nIt has been snowing all night, and the city is in a miserable condition.\nWe had a fine house last night for \"Carol\" and \"Trial,\" and such an\nenthusiastic one that they persisted in a call after the \"Carol,\" and,\nwhile I was out, covered the little table with flowers. The \"True\nAmerican\" has taken a fresh start, as if it were quite a novelty, and is\non the whole rather worse than ever to-day. The Cunard packet, the\n_Australasian_ (a poor ship), is some days overdue, and Dolby is\nanxiously looking out for her. There is a lull in the excitement about\nthe President, but the articles of impeachment are to be produced this\nafternoon, and then it may set in again. Osgood came into camp last\nnight from selling in remote places, and reports that at Rochester and\nBuffalo (both places near the frontier), Canada people bought tickets,\nwho had struggled across the frozen river and clambered over all sorts\nof obstructions to get them. Some of those halls turn out to be smaller\nthan represented, but I have no doubt, to use an American expression,\nthat we shall \"get along.\"\n\nTo-morrow fortnight we purpose being at the Falls of Niagara, and then\nwe shall turn back and really begin to wind up. I have got to know the\n\"Carol\" so well that I can't remember it, and occasionally go dodging\nabout in the wildest manner to pick up lost pieces. They took it so\ntremendously last night that I was stopped every five minutes. One poor\nyoung girl in mourning burst into a passion of grief about Tiny Tim, and\nwas taken out. This is all my news.\n\nEach of the pedestrians is endeavouring to persuade the other to take\nsomething unwholesome before starting.",

The railroad between this and\nNew York will probably be stopped somewhere. After all the hard weather\nwe have had, this is the worst day we have seen.\n\nThe walking-match came off on Saturday, over tremendously difficult\nground, against a biting wind, and through deep snow-wreaths. It was so\ncold, too, that our hair, beards, eyelashes, eyebrows, were frozen hard,\nand hung with icicles. The course was thirteen miles. They were close\ntogether at the turning-point, when Osgood went ahead at a splitting\npace and with extraordinary endurance, and won by half a mile. Dolby did\nvery well indeed, and begs that he may not be despised. In the evening I\ngave a very splendid dinner. Eighteen covers, most magnificent flowers,\nsuch table decoration as was never seen in these parts. The whole thing\nwas a great success, and everybody was delighted.\n\nI am holiday-making until Friday, when we start on the round of travel\nthat is to bring us back here for the 1st of April. My holiday-making\nis simply thorough resting, except on Wednesday, when I dine with\nLongfellow. There is still great political excitement, but I hope it may\nnot hurt us very much. My fear is that it may damage the farewell. Dolby\nis not of my mind as to this, and I hope he may be right. We are not\nquite determined whether Mrs. Fields did not desert our colours, by\ncoming on the ground in a carriage, and having _bread soaked in brandy_\nput into the winning man's mouth as he steamed along. She pleaded that\nshe would have done as much for Dolby, if _he_ had been ahead, so we are\ninclined to forgive her. As she had done so much for me in the way of\nflowers, I thought I would show her a sight in that line at the dinner.\nYou never saw anything like it. Two immense crowns; the base, of the\nchoicest exotics; and the loops, oval masses of violets. In the centre\nof the table an immense basket, overflowing with enormous bell-mouthed\nlilies; all round the table a bright green border of wreathed creeper,\nwith clustering roses at intervals; a rose for every button-hole, and a\nbouquet for every lady. They made an exhibition of the table before\ndinner to numbers of people.\n\nP. H. has just come in with a newspaper, containing a reference (in good\ntaste!) to the walking-match. He posts it to you by this post.\n\nIt is telegraphed that the storm prevails over an immense extent of\ncountry, and is just the same at Chicago as here. I hope it may prove a\nwind-up. We are getting sick of the sound of sleigh-bells even.\n\nYour account of Anne has greatly interested me.",

I am in the\nworst inn that ever was seen, and outside is a thaw that places the\nwhole country under water. I have looked out of window for the people,\nand I can't find any people. I have tried all the wines in the house,\nand there are only two wines, for which you pay six shillings a bottle,\nor fifteen, according as you feel disposed to change the name of the\nthing you ask for. (The article never changes.) The bill of fare is \"in\nFrench,\" and the principal article (the carte is printed) is \"Paettie de\nshay.\" I asked the Irish waiter what this dish was, and he said: \"It was\nthe name the steward giv' to oyster patties--the Frinch name.\" These are\nthe drinks you are to wash it down with: \"Mooseux,\" \"Abasinthe,\"\n\"Curacco,\" \"Marschine,\" \"Annise,\" and \"Margeaux\"!\n\nI am growing very home-sick, and very anxious for the 22nd of April; on\nwhich day, please God, I embark for home. I am beginning to be tired,\nand have been depressed all the time (except when reading), and have\nlost my appetite. I cannot tell you--but you know, and therefore why\nshould I?--how overjoyed I shall be to see you again, my dear boy, and\nhow sorely I miss a dear friend, and how sorely I miss all art, in these\nparts. No disparagement to the country, which has a great future in\nreserve, or to its people, who are very kind to me.\n\nI mean to take my leave of readings in the autumn and winter, in a final\nseries in England with Chappell. This will come into the way of literary\nwork for a time, for, after I have rested--don't laugh--it is a grim\nreality--I shall have to turn my mind to--ha! ha! ha!--to--ha! ha! ha!\n(more sepulchrally than before)--the--the CHRISTMAS NUMBER!!! I feel as\nif I had murdered a Christmas number years ago (perhaps I did!) and its\nghost perpetually haunted me. Nevertheless in some blessed rest at\nGad's, we will talk over stage matters, and all matters, in an even way,\nand see what we can make of them, please God. Be sure that I shall not\nbe in London one evening, after disembarking, without coming round to\nthe theatre to embrace you, my dear fellow.\n\nI have had an American cold (the worst in the world) since Christmas\nDay. I read four times a week, with the most tremendous energy I can\nbring to bear upon it. I travel about pretty heavily. I am very resolute\nabout calling on people, or receiving people, or dining out, and so save\nmyself a great deal. I read in all sorts of places--churches, theatres,\nconcert rooms, lecture halls. Every night I read I am described (mostly\nby people who have not the faintest notion of observing) from the sole\nof my boot to where the topmost hair of my head ought to be, but is not.\nSometimes I am described as being \"evidently nervous;\" sometimes it is\nrather taken ill that \"Mr. Dickens is so extraordinarily composed.\" My\neyes are blue, red, grey, white, green, brown, black, hazel, violet, and\nrainbow-coloured. I am like \"a well-to-do American gentleman,\" and the\nEmperor of the French, with an occasional touch of the Emperor of China,\nand a deterioration from the attributes of our famous townsman, Rufus W.\nB. D. Dodge Grumsher Pickville. I say all sorts of things that I never\nsaid, go to all sorts of places that I never saw or heard of, and have\ndone all manner of things (in some previous state of existence I\nsuppose) that have quite escaped my memory. You ask your friend to\ndescribe what he is about. This is what he is about, every day and hour\nof his American life.\n\nI hope to be back with you before you write to me!\n\n                  Ever, my dear Fechter,\n                             Your most affectionate and hearty Friend.\n\nP.S.--Don't let Madame Fechter, or Marie, or Paul forget me!",

But they scorched it too!\n\nYou would find the general aspect of America and Americans decidedly\nmuch improved. You would find immeasurably greater consideration and\nrespect for your privacy than of old. You would find a steady change for\nthe better everywhere, except (oddly enough) in the railroads generally,\nwhich seem to have stood still, while everything else has moved. But\nthere is an exception westward. There the express trains have now a very\ndelightful carriage called a \"drawing-room car,\" literally a series of\nlittle private drawing-rooms, with sofas and a table in each, opening\nout of a little corridor. In each, too, is a large plate-glass window,\nwith which you can do as you like. As you pay extra for this luxury, it\nmay be regarded as the first move towards two classes of passengers.\nWhen the railroad straight away to San Francisco (in six days) shall be\nopened through, it will not only have these drawing-rooms, but\nsleeping-rooms too; a bell in every little apartment communicating with\na steward's pantry, a restaurant, a staff of servants, marble\nwashing-stands, and a barber's shop! I looked into one of these cars a\nday or two ago, and it was very ingeniously arranged and quite complete.\n\nI left Niagara last Sunday, and travelled on to Albany, through three\nhundred miles of flood, villages deserted, bridges broken, fences\ndrifting away, nothing but tearing water, floating ice, and absolute\nwreck and ruin. The train gave in altogether at Utica, and the\npassengers were let loose there for the night. As I was due at Albany, a\nvery active superintendent of works did all he could to \"get Mr. Dickens\nalong,\" and in the morning we resumed our journey through the water,\nwith a hundred men in seven-league boots pushing the ice from before us\nwith long poles. How we got to Albany I can't say, but we got there\nsomehow, just in time for a triumphal \"Carol\" and \"Trial.\" All the\ntickets had been sold, and we found the Albanians in a state of great\nexcitement. You may imagine what the flood was when I tell you that we\ntook the passengers out of two trains that had their fires put out by\nthe water four-and-twenty hours before, and cattle from trucks that had\nbeen in the water I don't know how long, but so long that the sheep had\nbegun to eat each other! It was a horrible spectacle, and the haggard\nhuman misery of their faces was quite a new study. There was a fine\nbreath of spring in the air concurrently with the great thaw; but lo and\nbehold! last night it began to snow again with a strong wind, and to-day\na snowdrift covers this place with all the desolation of winter once\nmore. I never was so tired of the sight of snow. As to sleighing, I have\nbeen sleighing about to that extent, that I am sick of the sound of a\nsleigh-bell.\n\nI have seen all our Boston friends, except Curtis. Ticknor is dead. The\nrest are very little changed, except that Longfellow has a perfectly\nwhite flowing beard and long white hair. But he does not otherwise look\nold, and is infinitely handsomer than he was. I have been constantly\nwith them all, and they have always talked much of you. It is the\nestablished joke that Boston is my \"native place,\" and we hold all sorts\nof hearty foregatherings. They all come to every reading, and are always\nin a most delightful state of enthusiasm. They give me a parting dinner\nat the club, on the Thursday before Good Friday. To pass from Boston\npersonal to New York theatrical, I will mention here that one of the\nproprietors of my New York hotel is one of the proprietors of Niblo's,\nand the most active. Consequently I have seen the \"Black Crook\" and the\n\"White Fawn,\" in majesty, from an arm-chair in the first entrance, P.S.,\nmore than once. Of these astonishing dramas, I beg to report (seriously)\nthat I have found no human creature \"behind\" who has the slightest idea\nwhat they are about (upon my honour, my dearest Macready!), and that\nhaving some amiable small talk with a neat little Spanish woman, who is\nthe _premi\u00e8re danseuse_, I asked her, in joke, to let me measure her\nskirt with my dress glove. Holding the glove by the tip of the\nforefinger, I found the skirt to be just three gloves long, and yet its\nlength was much in excess of the skirts of two hundred other ladies,\nwhom the carpenters were at that moment getting into their places for a\ntransformation scene, on revolving columns, on wires and \"travellers\" in\niron cradles, up in the flies, down in the cellars, on every description\nof float that Wilmot, gone distracted, could imagine!\n\nI have taken my passage for Liverpool from New York in the Cunarder\n_Russia_, on the 22nd of April. I had the second officer's cabin on deck\ncoming out, and I have the chief steward's cabin on deck going home,\nbecause it will be on the sunny side of the ship. I have experienced\nnothing here but good humour and cordiality. In the autumn and winter I\nhave arranged with Chappells to take my farewell of reading in the\nUnited Kingdom for ever and ever.\n\nI am delighted to hear of Benvenuta's marriage, and I think her husband\na very lucky man. Johnnie has my profound sympathy under his\nexaminatorial woes. The noble boy will give me Gavazzi revised and\nenlarged, I expect, when I next come to Cheltenham.

But after\nto-morrow night, I have only the Boston and New York farewells, thank\nGod! I am most grateful to think that when we came to devise the details\nof the tour, I foresaw that it could never be done, as Dolby and Osgood\nproposed, by one unassisted man, as if he were a machine. If I had not\ncut out the work, and cut out Canada, I could never have gone there, I\nam quite sure.

However sympathetic and devoted the people are about\nme, they _can not_ be got to comprehend that one's being able to do the\ntwo hours with spirit when the time comes round, may be co-existent with\nthe consciousness of great depression and fatigue.

At twelve, a sherry cobbler and\na biscuit. At three (dinner time), a pint of champagne. At five minutes\nto eight, an egg beaten up with a glass of sherry.

But, _between ourselves_, I must add something else:\nI have the greatest objection to attend a funeral in which my affections\nare not strongly and immediately concerned. I have no notion of a\nfuneral as a matter of form or ceremony. And just as I should expressly\nprohibit the summoning to my own burial of anybody who was not very near\nor dear to me, so I revolt from myself appearing at that solemn rite\nunless the deceased were very near or dear to me. I cannot endure being\ndressed up by an undertaker as part of his trade show. I was not in this\npoor good fellow's house in his lifetime, and I feel that I have no\nbusiness there when he lies dead in it. My mind is penetrated with\nsympathy and compassion for the young widow, but that feeling is a real\nthing, and my attendance as a mourner would not be--to myself. It would\nbe to you, I know, but it would not be to myself. I know full well that\nyou cannot delegate to me your memories of and your associations with\nthe deceased, and the more true and tender they are the more invincible\nis my objection to become a form in the midst of the most awful\nrealities.\n\nWith love and condolence from Georgina, Mary, and Katie,\n\n                           Believe me, ever your affectionate Brother.",

I have begun something else\n(aboard the American mail-steamer); but I don't like it, because the\nstories must come limping in after the old fashion, though, of course,\nwhat I _have_ done will be good for A. Y. R. In short, I have cast about\nwith the greatest pains and patience, and I have been wholly unable to\nfind what I want.\n\nAnd yet I cannot quite make up my mind to give in without another fight\nfor it. I offered one hundred pounds reward at Gad's to anybody who\ncould suggest a notion to satisfy me. Charles Collins suggested one\nyesterday morning, in which there is _something_, though not much. I\nwill turn it over and over, and try a few more starts on my own account.\nFinally, I swear I will not give it up until August is out.

Neuralgia and colds beset me, either by turns or\nboth together, and I had often much to do to get through at night. But\nthe sea voyage home again did wonders in restoring me, and I have been\nvery well indeed, though a little fatigued, ever since. I am now\npreparing for a final reading campaign in England, Scotland, and\nIreland. It will begin on the 6th of October, and will probably last,\nwith short occasional intermissions, until June.\n\nThe great subject in England for the moment is the horrible accident to\nthe Irish mail-train. It is now supposed that the petroleum (known to be\na powerful an\u00e6sthetic) rendered the unfortunate people who were burnt\nalmost instantly insensible to any sensation. My escape in the\nStaplehurst accident of three years ago is not to be obliterated from my\nnervous system. To this hour I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even\nwhen riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite\ninsurmountable. I used to make nothing of driving a pair of horses\nhabitually through the most crowded parts of London. I cannot now drive,\nwith comfort to myself, on the country roads here; and I doubt if I\ncould ride at all in the saddle. My reading secretary and companion\nknows so well when one of these odd momentary seizures comes upon me in\na railway carriage, that he instantly produces a dram of brandy, which\nrallies the blood to the heart and generally prevails. I forget whether\nI ever told you that my watch (a chronometer) has never gone exactly\nsince the accident? So the Irish catastrophe naturally revives the\ndreadful things I saw that day.\n\nThe only other news here you know as well as I; to wit, that the country\nis going to be ruined, and that the Church is going to be ruined, and\nthat both have become so used to being ruined, that they will go on\nperfectly well.",

We must have no shadow of debt. Square up\neverything whatsoever that it has been necessary to buy. Let not a\nfarthing be outstanding on any account, when we begin together with your\nallowance. Be particular in the minutest detail.\n\nI wish to have no secret from you in the relations we are to establish\ntogether, and I therefore send you Joe Chitty's letter bodily. Reading\nit, you will know exactly what I know, and will understand that I treat\nyou with perfect confidence. It appears to me that an allowance of two\nhundred and fifty pounds a year will be handsome for all your wants, if\nI send you your wines. I mean this to include your tailor's bills as\nwell as every other expense; and I strongly recommend you to buy nothing\nin Cambridge, and to take credit for nothing but the clothes with which\nyour tailor provides you. As soon as you have got your furniture\naccounts in, let us wipe all those preliminary expenses clean out, and I\nwill then send you your first quarter. We will count in it October,\nNovember, and December; and your second quarter will begin with the New\nYear. If you dislike, at first, taking charge of so large a sum as\nsixty-two pounds ten shillings, you can have your money from me\nhalf-quarterly.\n\nYou know how hard I work for what I get, and I think you know that I\nnever had money help from any human creature after I was a child. You\nknow that you are one of many heavy charges on me, and that I trust to\nyour so exercising your abilities and improving the advantages of your\npast expensive education, as soon to diminish _this_ charge. I say no\nmore on that head.\n\nWhatever you do, above all other things keep out of debt and confide in\nme. If you ever find yourself on the verge of any perplexity or\ndifficulty, come to me. You will never find me hard with you while you\nare manly and truthful.\n\nAs your brothers have gone away one by one, I have written to each of\nthem what I am now going to write to you. You know that you have never\nbeen hampered with religious forms of restraint, and that with mere\nunmeaning forms I have no sympathy. But I most strongly and\naffectionately impress upon you the priceless value of the New\nTestament, and the study of that book as the one unfailing guide in\nlife. Deeply respecting it, and bowing down before the character of our\nSaviour, as separated from the vain constructions and inventions of men,\nyou cannot go very wrong, and will always preserve at heart a true\nspirit of veneration and humility. Similarly I impress upon you the\nhabit of saying a Christian prayer every night and morning. These things\nhave stood by me all through my life, and remember that I tried to\nrender the New Testament intelligible to you and lovable by you when you\nwere a mere baby.\n\nAnd so God bless you.\n\n                                        Ever your affectionate Father.",

It comes to hand here consequently to-day.\n\nI am diffident of addressing Mr. Gladstone on the subject of your desire\nto be appointed to the vacant Commissionership of Inland Revenue,\nbecause, although my respect for him and confidence in him are second to\nthose of no man in England (a bold word at this time, but a truthful\none), my personal acquaintance with him is very slight. But you may\nmake, through any of your friends, any use you please of this letter,\ntowards the end of bringing its contents under Mr. Gladstone's notice.\n\nIn expressing my conviction that you deserve the place, and are in every\nway qualified for it, I found my testimony upon as accurate a knowledge\nof your character and abilities as anyone can possibly have acquired. In\nmy editorship both of \"Household Words\" and \"All the Year Round,\" you\nknow very well that I have invariably offered you those subjects of\npolitical and social interest to write upon, in which integrity,\nexactness, a remarkable power of generalising evidence and balancing\nfacts, and a special clearness in stating the case, were indispensable\non the part of the writer. My confidence in your powers has never been\nmisplaced, and through all our literary intercourse you have never been\nhasty or wrong. Whatever trust you have undertaken has been so\ncompletely discharged, that it has become my habit to read your proofs\nrather for my own edification than (as in other cases) for the detection\nof some slip here or there, or the more pithy presentation of the\nsubject.\n\nThat your literary work has never interfered with the discharge of your\nofficial duties, I may assume to be at least as well known to your\ncolleagues as it is to me. It is idle to say that if the post were in my\ngift you should have it, because you have had, for some years, most of\nthe posts of high trust that have been at my disposal. An excellent\npublic servant in your literary sphere of action, I should be heartily\nglad if you could have this new opportunity of distinguishing yourself\nin the same character. And this is at least unselfish in me, for I\nsuppose I should then lose you?\n\n                                              Always faithfully yours.",

I need not tell you that I love you dearly,\nand am very, very sorry in my heart to part with you. But this life is\nhalf made up of partings, and these pains must be borne. It is my\ncomfort and my sincere conviction that you are going to try the life for\nwhich you are beat fitted. I think its freedom and wildness more suited\nto you than any experiment in a study or office would ever have been;\nand without that training, you could have followed no other suitable\noccupation.\n\nWhat you have already wanted until now has been a set, steady, constant\npurpose. I therefore exhort you to persevere in a thorough determination\nto do whatever you have to do as well as you can do it. I was not so old\nas you are now when I first had to win my food, and do this out of this\ndetermination, and I have never slackened in it since.\n\nNever take a mean advantage of anyone in any transaction, and never be\nhard upon people who are in your power. Try to do to others, as you\nwould have them do to you, and do not be discouraged if they fail\nsometimes. It is much better for you that they should fail in obeying\nthe greatest rule laid down by our Saviour, than that you should.\n\nI put a New Testament among your books, for the very same reasons, and\nwith the very same hopes that made me write an easy account of it for\nyou, when you were a little child; because it is the best book that ever\nwas or will be known in the world, and because it teaches you the best\nlessons by which any human creature who tries to be truthful and\nfaithful to duty can possibly be guided. As your brothers have gone\naway, one by one, I have written to each such words as I am now writing\nto you, and have entreated them all to guide themselves by this book,\nputting aside the interpretations and inventions of men.\n\nYou will remember that you have never at home been wearied about\nreligious observances or mere formalities. I have always been anxious\nnot to weary my children with such things before they are old enough to\nform opinions respecting them. You will therefore understand the better\nthat I now most solemnly impress upon you the truth and beauty of the\nChristian religion, as it came from Christ Himself, and the\nimpossibility of your going far wrong if you humbly but heartily respect\nit.\n\nOnly one thing more on this head. The more we are in earnest as to\nfeeling it, the less we are disposed to hold forth about it. Never\nabandon the wholesome practice of saying your own private prayers, night\nand morning. I have never abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of\nit.\n\nI hope you will always be able to say in after life, that you had a kind\nfather. You cannot show your affection for him so well, or make him so\nhappy, as by doing your duty.\n\n                                             Your affectionate Father.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[20] The Agricultural College, Cirencester.\n\n[21] \"No Thoroughfare.\"\n\n[22] The Mr. H.

Have I done with my farewell\nreadings? Lord bless you, no; and I shall think myself well out of it if\nI get done by the end of May. I have undertaken one hundred and six, and\nhave as yet only vanquished twenty-eight. To-morrow night I read in\nLondon for the first time the \"Murder\" from \"Oliver Twist,\" which I have\nre-arranged for the purpose. Next day I start for Dublin and Belfast. I\nam just back from Scotland for a few Christmas holidays. I go back there\nnext month; and in the meantime and afterwards go everywhere else.\n\nTake my guarantee for it, you may be quite comfortable on the subject of\npapal aspirations and encroachments. The English people are in\nunconquerable opposition to that church. They have the animosity in the\nblood, derived from the history of the past, though perhaps\nunconsciously. But they do sincerely want to win Ireland over if they\ncan. They know that since the Union she has been hardly used. They know\nthat Scotland has _her_ religion, and a very uncomfortable one. They\nknow that Scotland, though intensely anti-papal, perceives it to be\nunjust that Ireland has not _her_ religion too, and has very\nemphatically declared her opinion in the late elections. They know that\na richly-endowed church, forced upon a people who don't belong to it, is\na grievance with these people. They know that many things, but\nespecially an artfully and schemingly managed institution like the\nRomish Church, thrive upon a grievance, and that Rome has thriven\nexceedingly upon this, and made the most of it. Lastly, the best among\nthem know that there is a gathering cloud in the West, considerably\nbigger than a man's hand, under which a powerful Irish-American body,\nrich and active, is always drawing Ireland in that direction; and that\nthese are not times in which other powers would back our holding Ireland\nby force, unless we could make our claim good in proving fair and equal\ngovernment.\n\nPoor Townshend charged me in his will \"to publish without alteration his\nreligious opinions, which he sincerely believed would tend to the\nhappiness of mankind.\" To publish them without alteration is absolutely\nimpossible; for they are distributed in the strangest fragments through\nthe strangest note-books, pocket-books, slips of paper and what not, and\nproduce a most incoherent and tautological result. I infer that he must\nhave held some always-postponed idea of fitting them together. For these\nreasons I would certainly publish nothing about them, if I had any\ndiscretion in the matter. Having none, I suppose a book must be made.\nHis pictures and rings are gone to the South Kensington Museum, and are\nnow exhibiting there.\n\nCharley Collins is no better and no worse. Katie looks very young and\nvery pretty. Her sister and Miss Hogarth (my joint housekeepers) have\nbeen on duty this Christmas, and have had enough to do. My boys are now\nall dispersed in South America, India, and Australia, except Charley,\nwhom I have taken on at \"All the Year Round\" Office, and Henry, who is\nan undergraduate at Trinity Hall, and I hope will make his mark there.\nAll well.\n\nThe Thames Embankment is (faults of ugliness in detail apart) the finest\npublic work yet done. From Westminster Bridge to near Waterloo it is now\nlighted up at night, and has a fine effect. They have begun to plant it\nwith trees, and the footway (not the road) is already open to the\nTemple. Besides its beauty, and its usefulness in relieving the crowded\nstreets, it will greatly quicken and deepen what is learnedly called\nthe \"scour\" of the river. But the Corporation of London and some other\nnuisances have brought the weirs above Twickenham into a very bare and\nunsound condition, and they already begin to give and vanish, as the\nstream runs faster and stronger.\n\nYour undersigned friend has had a few occasional reminders of his \"true\nAmerican catarrh.\" Although I have exerted my voice very much, it has\nnot yet been once touched. In America I was obliged to patch it up\nconstantly.\n\nI like to read your patriarchal account of yourself among your Swiss\nvines and fig-trees. You wouldn't recognise Gad's Hill now; I have so\nchanged it, and bought land about it. And yet I often think that if Mary\nwere to marry (which she won't) I should sell it and go genteelly\nvagabondising over the face of the earth. Then indeed I might see\nLausanne again. But I don't seem in the way of it at present, for the\nolder I get, the more I do and the harder I work.\n\n                                            Yours ever affectionately.",

It is as sorrowful as anything so peaceful and\ntrustful can be!\n\nBoth my feet are very tender, and often feel as though they were in hot\nwater. But I was wonderfully well and strong, thank God! and had no end\nof voice for the two nights running in that great Birmingham hall. We\nhad enormous houses.\n\nSo far as I understand the dinner arrangements here, they are much too\nlong. As to the acoustics of that hall, and the position of the tables\n(both as bad as bad can be), my only consolation is that, if anybody can\nbe heard, _I_ probably can be. The honorary secretary tells me that six\nhundred people are to dine. The mayor, being no speaker and out of\nhealth besides, hands over the toast of the evening to Lord Dufferin.\nThe town is full of the festival. The Theatre Royal, touched up for the\noccasion, will look remarkably bright and well for the readings, and our\nlets are large. It is remarkable that our largest let as yet is for\nThursday, not Friday. I infer that the dinner damages Friday, but Dolby\ndoes not think so. There appears to be great curiosity to hear the\n\"Murder.\" (On Friday night last I read to two thousand people, and odd\nhundreds.)\n\nI hear that Anthony Trollope, Dixon, Lord Houghton, Lemon, Esquiros (of\nthe _Revue des Deux Mondes_), and Sala are to be called upon to speak;\nthe last, for the newspaper press. All the Liverpool notabilities are to\nmuster. And Manchester is to be represented by its mayor with due\nformality.\n\nI had been this morning to look at St. George's Hall, and suggest what\ncan be done to improve its acoustics. As usually happens in such cases,\ntheir most important arrangements are already made and unchangeable. I\nshould not have placed the tables in the committee's way at all, and\ncould certainly have placed the da\u00efs to much greater advantage. So all\nthe good I could do was to show where banners could be hung with some\nhope of stopping echoes. Such is my small news, soon exhausted. We\narrived here at three yesterday afternoon; it is now mid-day; Chorley\nhas not yet appeared, but he had called at the local agent's while I was\nat Birmingham.\n\nIt is a curious little instance of the way in which things fit together\nthat there is a ship-of-war in the Mersey, whose flags and so forth are\nto be brought up to St. George's Hall for the dinner. She is the\n_Donegal_, of which Paynter told me he had just been captain, when he\ntold me all about Sydney at Bath.\n\nOne of the pleasantest things I have experienced here this time, is the\nmanner in which I am stopped in the streets by working men, who want to\nshake hands with me, and tell me they know my books. I never go out but\nthis happens. Down at the docks just now, a cooper with a fearful\nstutter presented himself in this way. His modesty, combined with a\nconviction that if he were in earnest I would see it and wouldn't repel\nhim, made up as true a piece of natural politeness as I ever saw.",

Above all things I am delighted with the prospect\nof seeing you here next summer; a prospect which has been received with\nnine times nine and one more by the whole house. You will hardly know\nthe place again, it is so changed. You are not expected to admire, but\nthere _is_ a conservatory building at this moment--be still, my soul!\n\nThis leaves me in the preliminary agonies of a new book, which I hope to\nbegin publishing (in twelve numbers, not twenty) next March. The coming\nreadings being all in London, and being, after the first fortnight, only\nonce a week, will divert my attention very little, I hope.\n\nHarry has just gone up to Cambridge again, and I hope will get a\nfellowship in good time.\n\nWills is much gratified by your remembrance, and sends you his warm\nregard. He wishes me to represent that he is very little to be pitied.\nThat he suffers no pain, scarcely inconvenience, even, so long as he is\nidle. That he likes idleness exceedingly. He has bought a country place\nby Welwyn in Hertfordshire, near Lytton's, and takes possession\npresently.\n\nMy boy Sydney is now a second lieutenant, the youngest in the Service, I\nbelieve. He has the highest testimonials as an officer.\n\nYou may be quite sure there will be no international racing in American\nwaters. Oxford knows better, or I am mistaken. The Harvard crew were a\nvery good set of fellows, and very modest.\n\nRyland of Birmingham doesn't look a day older, and was full of interest\nin you, and asked me to remind you of him. By-the-bye, at Elkington's I\nsaw a pair of immense tea-urns from a railway station (Stafford), sent\nthere to be repaired.

Therefore I think it well merely to\nmention that I have received no other note.\n\nI do not wonder at your not being up to the undertaking (even if you had\nhad no cough) under the wearing circumstances.

I set myself\nto carrying out of themselves and their observation, those who were bent\non watching how the effects were got; and I believe I succeeded. Coming\nback to it again, however, I feel it was madness ever to do it so\ncontinuously. My ordinary pulse is seventy-two, and it runs up under\nthis effort to one hundred and twelve. Besides which, it takes me ten or\ntwelve minutes to get my wind back at all; I being, in the meantime,\nlike the man who lost the fight--in fact, his express image. Frank Beard\nwas in attendance to make divers experiments to report to Watson; and\nalthough, as you know, he stopped it instantly when he found me at\nPreston, he was very much astonished by the effects of the reading on\nthe reader.\n\nSo I hope you may be able to come and hear it before it is silent for\never. It is done again on the evenings of the 1st February, 15th\nFebruary, and 8th March. I hope, now I have got over the mornings, that\nI may be able to work on my book. But up to this time the great\npreparation required in getting the subjects up again, and the twice a\nweek besides, have almost exclusively occupied me.\n\nI have something the matter with my right thumb, and can't (as you see)\nwrite plainly.

I am truly shocked to find that any reader can\nmake the mistake\n\nI have always striven in my writings to express veneration for the life\nand lessons of our Saviour; because I feel it; and because I re-wrote\nthat history for my children--every one of whom knew it from having it\nrepeated to them--long before they could read, and almost as soon as\nthey could speak.\n\nBut I have never made proclamation of this from the house tops\n\n                                          Faithfully Yours,\n                                                       Charles Dickens\n\nJohn M. Markham Esq.]\n\nAll through this spring in London, Charles Dickens had been ailing in\nhealth, and it was remarked by many friends that he had a weary look,\nand was \"aged\" and altered. But he was generally in good spirits, and\nhis family had no uneasiness about him, relying upon the country quiet\nand comparative rest at Gad's Hill to have their usual influence in\nrestoring his health and strength. On the 2nd June he attended a private\nplay at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Freake, where his two daughters were\namong the actresses. The next day he went back to Gad's Hill. His\ndaughter Kate (whose home was there at all times when she chose, and\nalmost always through the summer months) went down on Sunday, the 5th\nJune, for a day's visit, to see the \"great improvement of the\nconservatory.\" Her father laughingly assured her she had now seen \"the\nlast\" improvement at Gad's Hill. At this time he was tolerably well, but\nshe remarked to her sister and aunt how strangely he was tired, and what\na curious grey colour he had in his face after a very short walk on that\nSunday afternoon. However, he seemed quite himself again in the evening.\nThe next day his daughter Kate went back, accompanied by her sister, who\nwas to pay her a short visit, to London.\n\nCharles Dickens was very hard at work on the sixth number of \"Edwin\nDrood.\" On the Monday and Tuesday he was well, but he was unequal to\nmuch exercise. His last walk was one of his greatest favourites--through\nCobham Park and Wood--on the afternoon of Tuesday.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, the 8th (one of the loveliest days of a\nlovely summer), he was very well; in excellent spirits about his book,\nof which he said he _must_ finish his number that day--the next\n(Thursday) being the day of his weekly visit to \"All the Year Round\"\noffice. Therefore, he would write all day in the Ch\u00e2let, and take no\nwalk or drive until the evening. In the middle of the day he came to the\nhouse for an hour's rest, and smoked a cigar in the conservatory--out of\nwhich new addition to the house he was taking the greatest personal\nenjoyment--and seemed perfectly well, and exceedingly cheerful and\nhopeful. When he came again to the house, about an hour before the time\nfixed for the early dinner, he seemed very tired, silent, and absorbed.\nBut this was so usual with him after a day of engrossing work, that it\ncaused no alarm or surprise to his sister-in-law--the only member of his\nhousehold who happened to be at home. He wrote some letters--among them,\nthese last letters which we give--in the library of the house, and also\narranged many trifling business matters, with a view to his departure\nfor London the next morning. He was to be accompanied, on his return at\nthe end of the week, by Mr. Fildes, to introduce the \"new illustrator\"\nto the neighbourhood in which many of the scenes of this last book of\nCharles Dickens, as of his first, were laid.\n\nIt was not until they were seated at the dinner-table that a striking\nchange in the colour and expression of his face startled his\nsister-in-law, and on her asking him if he was ill, he said, \"Yes, very\nill; I have been very ill for the last hour.\" But on her expressing an\nintention of sending instantly for a doctor, he stopped her, and said:\n\"No, he would go on with dinner, and go afterwards to London.\" And then\nhe made an effort to struggle against the fit that was fast coming on\nhim, and talked, but incoherently, and soon very indistinctly. It being\nnow evident that he _was_ ill, and very seriously ill, his sister-in-law\nbegged him to come to his own room before she sent off for medical help.\n\"Come and lie down,\" she entreated. \"Yes, on the ground,\" he said, very\ndistinctly--these were the last words he spoke--and he slid from her\narm, and fell upon the floor.\n\nThe servants brought a couch into the dining-room, where he was laid. A\nmessenger was despatched for Mr. Steele, the Rochester doctor, and with\na telegram to his doctor in London, and to his daughters. This was a few\nminutes after six o'clock.\n\nHis daughters arrived, with Mr. Frank Beard, this same evening. His\neldest son the next morning, and his son Henry and his sister Letitia in\nthe evening of the 9th--too late, alas!\n\nAll through the night, Charles Dickens never opened his eyes, or showed\na sign of consciousness. In the afternoon of the 9th, Dr. Russell\nReynolds arrived at Gad's Hill, having been summoned by Mr. Frank Beard\nto meet himself and Mr. Steele. But he could only confirm their hopeless\nverdict, and made his opinion known with much kind sympathy, to the\nfamily, before returning to London.\n\nCharles Dickens remained in the same unconscious state until the evening\nof this day, when, at ten minutes past six, the watchers saw a shudder\npass over him, heard him give a deep sigh, saw one tear roll down his\ncheek, and he was gone from them. And as they saw the dark shadow steal\nacross his calm, beautiful face, not one among them--could they have\nbeen given such a power--would have recalled his sweet spirit back to\nearth.\n\nAs his family were aware that Charles Dickens had a wish to be buried\nnear Gad's Hill, arrangements were made for his burial in the pretty\nchurchyard of Shorne, a neighbouring village, of which he was very fond.\nBut this intention was abandoned in consequence of a pressing request\nfrom the Dean and Chapter of Rochester Cathedral that his remains might\nbe placed there. A grave was prepared and everything arranged, when it\nwas made known to the family, through Dean Stanley, that there was a\ngeneral and very earnest desire that Charles Dickens should find his\nresting-place in Westminster Abbey. To such a fitting tribute to his\nmemory they could make no possible objection, although it was with great\nregret that they relinquished the idea of laying him in a place so\nclosely identified with his life and his works. His name,\nnotwithstanding, is associated with Rochester, a tablet to his memory\nhaving been placed by his executors on the wall of Rochester Cathedral.\n\nWith regard to Westminster Abbey, his family only stipulated that the\nfuneral might be made as private as possible, and that the words of his\nwill, \"I emphatically direct that I be buried in an inexpensive,\nunostentatious, and strictly private manner,\" should be religiously\nadhered to. And so they were. The solemn service in the vast cathedral\nbeing as private as the most thoughtful consideration could make it.\n\nThe family of Charles Dickens were deeply grateful to all in authority\nwho so carried out his wishes. And more especially to Dean Stanley and\nto the (late) Lady Augusta Stanley, for the tender sympathy shown by\nthem to the mourners on this day, and also on Sunday, the 19th, when the\nDean preached his beautiful funeral sermon.\n\nAs during his life Charles Dickens's fondness for air, light, and gay\ncolours amounted almost to a passion, so when he lay dead in the home he\nhad so dearly loved, these things were not forgotten.\n\nThe pretty room opening into the conservatory (from which he had never\nbeen removed since his seizure) was kept bright with the most beautiful\nof all kinds of flowers, and flooded with the summer sun:\n\n        \"And nothing stirred in the room. The old, old\n        fashion. The fashion that came in with our\n        first garments, and will last unchanged until\n        our race has run its course, and the wide\n        firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old,\n        old fashion--death!\n\n        \"Oh, thank God, all who see it, for that older\n        fashion yet, of immortality!\"\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[37] This letter has lately been presented by Mr. Charles Kent to the\nBritish Museum.",

Of course this observation applies only to that particular\nsong.\n\nBraham having sent to me about the farce, I called on him this morning.\nHarley wrote, when he had read the whole of the opera, saying: \"It's a\nsure card--nothing wrong there. Bet you ten pound it runs fifty nights.\nCome; don't be afraid. You'll be the gainer by it, and you mustn't mind\nbetting; it's a capital custom.\" They tell the story with infinite\nrelish. I saw the fair manageress,[2] who is fully of Harley's opinion,\nso is Braham. The only difference is, that they are far more\nenthusiastic than Harley--far more enthusiastic than ourselves even.\nThat is a bold word, isn't it? It is a true one, nevertheless.\n\n\"Depend upon it, sir,\" said Braham to Hogarth yesterday, when he went\nthere to say I should be in town to-day, \"depend upon it, sir, that\nthere has been no such music since the days of Sheil, and no such piece\nsince \"The Duenna.\"\" \"Everybody is delighted with it,\" he added, to me\nto-day. \"I played it to Stansbury, who is by no means an excitable\nperson, and he was charmed.\" This was said with great emphasis, but I\nhave forgotten the grand point. It was not, \"I played it to Stansbury,\"\nbut, \"I sang it--_all through_!!!\"\n\nI begged him, as the choruses are to be put into rehearsal directly the\ncompany get together, to let us have, through Mrs. Braham, the necessary\npassports to the stage, which will be forwarded. He leaves town on the\n_8th of September_. He will be absent a month, and the first rehearsal\nwill take place immediately on his return; previous to it (I mean the\nfirst rehearsal--not the return) I am to read the piece. His only\nremaining suggestion is, that Miss Rainforth will want another song when\nthe piece is in rehearsal--\"a bravura--something in the 'Soldier Tired'\nway.\" We must have a confab about this on Wednesday morning.\n\nHarley called in Furnival's Inn, to express his high delight and\ngratification, but unfortunately we had left town. I shall be at\nhead-quarters by 12 Wednesday noon.\n\n                                 Believe me, dear Hullah,\n                                                Most faithfully yours.\n\nP.S.--Tell me on Wednesday when you can come down here, for a day or\ntwo.

I can recall everything she said and did in those happy days, and\ncould show you every passage and line we read together.\n\nI see _now_ how you are capable of making great efforts, even against\nthe afflictions you have to deplore, and I hope that, soon, our words\nmay be where our thoughts are, and that we may call up those old\nmemories, not as shadows of the bitter past, but as lights upon a\nhappier future.\n\n                    Believe me, my dear Mrs. Hogarth,\n                                  Ever truly and affectionately yours.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] \"The Village Coquettes.\"\n\n[2] Mrs. Braham.\n\n[3] Printed in \"Forty Years' Recollections of Life, Literature, and\nPublic Affairs,\" by Charles Mackay.\n\n[4] A chain made of Mary Hogarth's hair, sent to Charles Dickens on the\nfirst anniversary of her birthday, after her death.\n\n\n\n\n[5]DIARY--1838.\n\n\n                                          _Monday, January 1st, 1838._\n\nA sad New Year's Day in one respect, for at the opening of last year\npoor Mary was with us. Very many things to be grateful for since then,\nhowever. Increased reputation and means--good health and prospects. We\nnever know the full value of blessings till we lose them (we were not\nignorant of this one when we had it, I hope). But if she were with us\nnow, the same winning, happy, amiable companion, sympathising with all\nmy thoughts and feelings more than anyone I knew ever did or will, I\nthink I should have nothing to wish for, but a continuance of such\nhappiness. But she is gone, and pray God I may one day, through his\nmercy, rejoin her. I wrote to Mrs. Hogarth yesterday, taking advantage\nof the opportunity afforded me by her sending, as a New Year's token, a\npen-wiper of poor Mary's, imploring her, as strongly as I could, to\nthink of the many remaining claims upon her affection and exertions, and\nnot to give way to unavailing grief. Her answer came to-night, and she\nseems hurt at my doing so--protesting that in all useful respects she is\nthe same as ever. Meant it for the best, and still hope I did right.\n\n\n                                        _Saturday, January 6th, 1838._\n\nOur boy's birthday--one year old. A few people at night--only Forster,\nthe De Gex's, John Ross, Mitton, and the Beards, besides our\nfamilies--to twelfth-cake and forfeits.\n\nThis day last year, Mary and I wandered up and down Holborn and the\nstreets about for hours, looking after a little table for Kate's\nbedroom, which we bought at last at the very first broker's which we had\nlooked into, and which we had passed half-a-dozen times because I\n_didn't like_ to ask the price. I took her out to Brompton at night, as\nwe had no place for her to sleep in (the two mothers being with us); she\ncame back again next day to keep house for me, and stopped nearly the\nrest of the month. I shall never be so happy again as in those chambers\nthree storeys high--never if I roll in wealth and fame. I would hire\nthem to keep empty, if I could afford it.\n\n\n                                          _Monday, January 8th, 1838._\n\nI began the \"Sketches of Young Gentlemen\" to-day. One hundred and\ntwenty-five pounds for such a little book, without my name to it, is\npretty well. This and the \"Sunday\"[6] by-the-bye, are the only two\nthings I have not done as Boz.\n\n\n                                         _Tuesday, January 9th, 1838._\n\nWent to the Sun office to insure my life, where the Board seemed\ndisposed to think I work too much. Made Forster and Pickthorn, my\nDoctor, the references--and after an interesting interview with the\nBoard and the Board's Doctor, came away to work again.\n\n\n                                      _Wednesday, January 10th, 1838._\n\nAt work all day, and to a quadrille party at night. City people and\nrather dull. Intensely cold coming home, and vague reports of a fire\nsomewhere. Frederick says the Royal Exchange, at which I sneer most\nsagely; for----\n\n\n                                       _Thursday, January 11th, 1838._\n\nTo-day the papers are full of it, and it _was_ the Royal Exchange,\nLloyd's, and all the shops round the building. Called on Browne and went\nwith him to see the ruins, of which we saw as much as we should have\ndone if we had stopped at home.\n\n\n                                         _Sunday, January 14th, 1838._\n\nTo church in the morning, and when I came home I wrote the preceding\nportion of this diary, which henceforth I make a steadfast resolution\nnot to neglect, or _paint_. I have not done it yet, nor will I; but say\nwhat rises to my lips--my mental lips at least--without reserve. No\nother eyes will see it, while mine are open in life, and although I\ndaresay I shall be ashamed of a good deal in it, I should like to look\nover it at the year's end.\n\nIn Scott's diary, which I have been looking at this morning, there are\nthoughts which have been mine by day and by night, in good spirits and\nbad, since Mary died.\n\n\"Another day, and a bright one to the external world again opens on us;\nthe air soft, and the flowers smiling, and the leaves glittering. They\ncannot refresh her to whom mild weather was a natural enjoyment.\nCerements of lead and of wood already hold her; cold earth must have her\nsoon. But it is not . . . (she) who will be laid among the ruins. . . .\nShe is sentient and conscious of my emotions _somewhere_--where, we cannot\ntell, how, we cannot tell; yet would I not at this moment renounce the\nmysterious yet certain hope that I shall see her in a better world, for\nall that this world can give me.\n\n                                   \n\n\"I have seen her. There is the same symmetry of form, though those limbs\nare rigid which were once so gracefully elastic; but that yellow masque\nwith pinched features, which seems to mock life rather than emulate it,\ncan it be the face that was once so full of lively expression? I will\nnot look upon it again.\"\n\nI know but too well how true all this is.\n\n\n                                         _Monday, January 15th, 1838._\n\nHere ends this brief attempt at a diary.

To suppose that I could gravely take\nupon myself the responsibility of withdrawing you from pursuits you have\nalready undertaken, or urging you on in a most uncertain and hazardous\ncourse of life, is really a compliment to my judgment and inflexibility\nwhich I cannot recognize and do not deserve (or desire).

It would make my heart glad to\ncompare notes with you about that shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat\nand red nose, who sat in the nine-cornered back-parlour of the Masons'\nArms; and about Robert Preston and the tallow-chandler's widow, whose\nsitting-room is second nature to me; and about all those delightful\nplaces and people that I used to walk about and dream of in the daytime,\nwhen a very small and not over-particularly-taken-care-of boy. I have a\ngood deal to say, too, about that dashing Alonzo de Ojeda, that you\ncan't help being fonder of than you ought to be; and much to hear\nconcerning Moorish legend, and poor unhappy Boabdil. Diedrich\nKnickerbocker I have worn to death in my pocket, and yet I should show\nyou his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression.\n\nI have been so accustomed to associate you with my pleasantest and\nhappiest thoughts, and with my leisure hours, that I rush at once into\nfull confidence with you, and fall, as it were naturally, and by the\nvery laws of gravity, into your open arms. Questions come thronging to\nmy pen as to the lips of people who meet after long hoping to do so. I\ndon't know what to say first or what to leave unsaid, and am constantly\ndisposed to break off and tell you again how glad I am this moment has\narrived.\n\nMy dear Washington Irving, I cannot thank you enough for your cordial\nand generous praise, or tell you what deep and lasting gratification it\nhas given me. I hope to have many letters from you, and to exchange a\nfrequent correspondence. I send this to say so. After the first two or\nthree I shall settle down into a connected style, and become gradually\nrational.\n\nYou know what the feeling is, after having written a letter, sealed it,\nand sent it off. I shall picture your reading this, and answering it\nbefore it has lain one night in the post-office. Ten to one that before\nthe fastest packet could reach New York I shall be writing again.\n\nDo you suppose the post-office clerks care to receive letters? I have my\ndoubts. They get into a dreadful habit of indifference. A postman, I\nimagine, is quite callous. Conceive his delivering one to himself,\nwithout being startled by a preliminary double knock!\n\n                                          Always your faithful Friend.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[12] A Dissenting minister, once himself a workhouse boy, and writing on\nthe character of Oliver Twist.

We and the oysters missed you\nterribly in New York. You carried away with you more than half the\ndelight and pleasure of my New World; and I heartily wish you could\nbring it back again.\n\nThere are very interesting men in this place--highly interesting, of\ncourse--but it's not a comfortable place; is it? If spittle could wait\nat table we should be nobly attended, but as that property has not been\nimparted to it in the present state of mechanical science, we are rather\nlonely and orphan-like, in respect of \"being looked arter.\" A blithe\nblack was introduced on our arrival, as our peculiar and especial\nattendant. He is the only gentleman in the town who has a peculiar\ndelicacy in intruding upon my valuable time. It usually takes seven\nrings and a threatening message from ---- to produce him; and when he\ncomes he goes to fetch something, and, forgetting it by the way, comes\nback no more.\n\nWe have been in great distress, really in distress, at the non-arrival\nof the _Caledonia_. You may conceive what our joy was, when, while we\nwere dining out yesterday, H. arrived with the joyful intelligence of\nher safety. The very news of her having really arrived seemed to\ndiminish the distance between ourselves and home, by one half at least.\n\nAnd this morning (though we have not yet received our heap of\ndespatches, for which we are looking eagerly forward to this night's\nmail)--this morning there reached us unexpectedly, through the\nGovernment bag (Heaven knows how they came there!), two of our many and\nlong-looked-for letters, wherein was a circumstantial account of the\nwhole conduct and behaviour of our pets; with marvellous narrations of\nCharley's precocity at a Twelfth Night juvenile party at Macready's; and\ntremendous predictions of the governess, dimly suggesting his having got\nout of pot-hooks and hangers, and darkly insinuating the possibility of\nhis writing us a letter before long; and many other workings of the same\nprophetic spirit, in reference to him and his sisters, very gladdening\nto their mother's heart, and not at all depressing to their father's.\nThere was, also, the doctor's report, which was a clean bill; and the\nnurse's report, which was perfectly electrifying; showing as it did how\nMaster Walter had been weaned, and had cut a double tooth, and done many\nother extraordinary things, quite worthy of his high descent. In short,\nwe were made very happy and grateful; and felt as if the prodigal father\nand mother had got home again.\n\nWhat do you think of this incendiary card being left at my door last\nnight? \"General G. sends compliments to Mr. Dickens, and called with two\nliterary ladies. As the two L. L.'s are ambitious of the honour of a\npersonal introduction to Mr. D., General G. requests the honour of an\nappointment for to-morrow.\" I draw a veil over my sufferings. They are\nsacred. We shall be in Buffalo, please Heaven, on the 30th of April. If\nI don't find a letter from you in the care of the postmaster at that\nplace, I'll never write to you from England.\n\nBut if I _do_ find one, my right hand shall forget its cunning, before I\nforget to be your truthful and constant correspondent; not, dear Felton,\nbecause I promised it, nor because I have a natural tendency to\ncorrespond (which is far from being the case), nor because I am truly\ngrateful to you for, and have been made truly proud by, that\naffectionate and elegant tribute which ---- sent me, but because you are\na man after my own heart, and I love you _well_. And for the love I bear\nyou, and the pleasure with which I shall always think of you, and the\nglow I shall feel when I see your handwriting in my own home, I hereby\nenter into a solemn league and covenant to write as many letters to you\nas you write to me, at least. Amen.\n\nCome to England! Come to England! Our oysters are small, I know; they\nare said by Americans to be coppery; but our hearts are of the largest\nsize. We are thought to excel in shrimps, to be far from despicable in\npoint of lobsters, and in periwinkles are considered to challenge the\nuniverse. Our oysters, small though they be, are not devoid of the\nrefreshing influence which that species of fish is supposed to exercise\nin these latitudes.

I anticipated objection to Carlyle's[18] letter. I\ncalled particular attention to it for three reasons. Firstly, because he\nboldly _said_ what all the others _think_, and therefore deserved to be\nmanfully supported. Secondly, because it is my deliberate opinion that I\nhave been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any\npretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an\nopinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in\nany other country. . . .\n\nI really cannot sufficiently thank you, dear Felton, for your warm and\nhearty interest in these proceedings. But it would be idle to pursue\nthat theme, so let it pass.\n\nThe wig and whiskers are in a state of the highest preservation. The\nplay comes off next Wednesday night, the 25th. What would I give to see\nyou in the front row of the centre box, your spectacles gleaming not\nunlike those of my dear friend Pickwick, your face radiant with as broad\na grin as a staid professor may indulge in, and your very coat,\nwaistcoat, and shoulders expressive of what we should take together when\nthe performance was over! I would give something (not so much, but still\na good round sum) if you could only stumble into that very dark and\ndusty theatre in the daytime (at any minute between twelve and three),\nand see me with my coat off, the stage manager and universal director,\nurging impracticable ladies and impossible gentlemen on to the very\nconfines of insanity, shouting and driving about, in my own person, to\nan extent which would justify any philanthropic stranger in clapping me\ninto a strait-waistcoat without further inquiry, endeavouring to goad H.\ninto some dim and faint understanding of a prompter's duties, and\nstruggling in such a vortex of noise, dirt, bustle, confusion, and\ninextricable entanglement of speech and action as you would grow giddy\nin contemplating. We perform \"A Roland for an Oliver,\" \"A Good Night's\nRest,\" and \"Deaf as a Post.\" This kind of voluntary hard labour used to\nbe my great delight. The _furor_ has come strong upon me again, and I\nbegin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the lessee\nof a national theatre, and that pen, ink, and paper have spoiled a\nmanager.\n\nOh, how I look forward across that rolling water to home and its small\ntenantry! How I busy myself in thinking how my books look, and where\nthe tables are, and in what positions the chairs stand relatively to the\nother furniture; and whether we shall get there in the night, or in the\nmorning, or in the afternoon; and whether we shall be able to surprise\nthem, or whether they will be too sharply looking out for us; and what\nour pets will say; and how they'll look, and who will be the first to\ncome and shake hands, and so forth! If I could but tell you how I have\nset my heart on rushing into Forster's study (he is my great friend, and\nwrites at the bottom of all his letters: \"My love to Felton\"), and into\nMaclise's painting-room, and into Macready's managerial ditto, without a\nmoment's warning, and how I picture every little trait and circumstance\nof our arrival to myself, down to the very colour of the bow on the\ncook's cap, you would almost think I had changed places with my eldest\nson, and was still in pantaloons of the thinnest texture. I left all\nthese things--God only knows what a love I have for them--as coolly and\ncalmly as any animated cucumber; but when I come upon them again I shall\nhave lost all power of self-restraint, and shall as certainly make a\nfool of myself (in the popular meaning of that expression) as ever\nGrimaldi did in his way, or George the Third in his.\n\nAnd not the less so, dear Felton, for having found some warm hearts, and\nleft some instalments of earnest and sincere affection, behind me on\nthis continent. And whenever I turn my mental telescope hitherward,\ntrust me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear\nspectacles so like yours that the maker couldn't tell the difference,\nand shall address a Greek class in such an exact imitation of your\nvoice, that the very students hearing it should cry, \"That's he! Three\ncheers. Hoo-ray-ay-ay-ay-ay!\"\n\nAbout those joints of yours, I think you are mistaken. They _can't_ be\nstiff. At the worst they merely want the air of New York, which, being\nimpregnated with the flavour of last year's oysters, has a surprising\neffect in rendering the human frame supple and flexible in all cases of\nrust.\n\nA terrible idea occurred to me as I wrote those words. The\noyster-cellars--what do they do when oysters are not in season? Is\npickled salmon vended there? Do they sell crabs, shrimps, winkles,\nherrings? The oyster-openers--what do _they_ do? Do they commit suicide\nin despair, or wrench open tight drawers and cupboards and\nhermetically-sealed bottles for practice? Perhaps they are dentists out\nof the oyster season.

The dinners I have had to eat, the places I have had to go\nto, the letters I have had to answer, the sea of business and of\npleasure in which I have been plunged, not even the genius of an ---- or\nthe pen of a ---- could describe.\n\nWherefore I indite a monstrously short and wildly uninteresting epistle\nto the American Dando; but perhaps you don't know who Dando was. He was\nan oyster-eater, my dear Felton. He used to go into oyster-shops,\nwithout a farthing of money, and stand at the counter eating natives,\nuntil the man who opened them grew pale, cast down his knife, staggered\nbackward, struck his white forehead with his open hand, and cried, \"You\nare Dando!!!\" He has been known to eat twenty dozen at one sitting, and\nwould have eaten forty, if the truth had not flashed upon the\nshopkeeper. For these offences he was constantly committed to the House\nof Correction. During his last imprisonment he was taken ill, got worse\nand worse, and at last began knocking violent double knocks at Death's\ndoor. The doctor stood beside his bed, with his fingers on his pulse.\n\"He is going,\" says the doctor. \"I see it in his eye. There is only one\nthing that would keep life in him for another hour, and that\nis--oysters.\" They were immediately brought. Dando swallowed eight, and\nfeebly took a ninth. He held it in his mouth and looked round the bed\nstrangely. \"Not a bad one, is it?\" says the doctor. The patient shook\nhis head, rubbed his trembling hand upon his stomach, bolted the oyster,\nand fell back--dead. They buried him in the prison-yard, and paved his\ngrave with oyster-shells.\n\nWe are all well and hearty, and have already begun to wonder what time\nnext year you and Mrs. Felton and Dr. Howe will come across the briny\nsea together. To-morrow we go to the seaside for two months. I am\nlooking out for news of Longfellow, and shall be delighted when I know\nthat he is on his way to London and this house.\n\nI am bent upon striking at the piratical newspapers with the sharpest\nedge I can put upon my small axe, and hope in the next session of\nParliament to stop their entrance into Canada. For the first time within\nthe memory of man, the professors of English literature seem disposed to\nact together on this question. It is a good thing to aggravate a\nscoundrel, if one can do nothing else, and I think we _can_ make them\nsmart a little in this way. . . .\n\nI wish you had been at Greenwich the other day, where a party of friends\ngave me a private dinner; public ones I have refused. C---- was\nperfectly wild at the reunion, and, after singing all manner of marine\nsongs, wound up the entertainment by coming home (six miles) in a\nlittle open phaeton of mine, _on his head_, to the mingled delight and\nindignation of the metropolitan police. We were very jovial indeed; and\nI assure you that I drank your health with fearful vigour and energy.\n\nOn board that ship coming home I established a club, called the United\nVagabonds, to the large amusement of the rest of the passengers. This\nholy brotherhood committed all kinds of absurdities, and dined always,\nwith a variety of solemn forms, at one end of the table, below the mast,\naway from all the rest. The captain being ill when we were three or four\ndays out, I produced my medicine-chest and recovered him. We had a few\nmore sick men after that, and I went round \"the wards\" every day in\ngreat state, accompanied by two Vagabonds, habited as Ben Allen and Bob\nSawyer, bearing enormous rolls of plaster and huge pairs of scissors. We\nwere really very merry all the way, breakfasted in one party at\nLiverpool, shook hands, and parted most cordially. . . .\n\n                                  Affectionately your faithful friend.\n\nP.S.--I have looked over my journal, and have decided to produce my\nAmerican trip in two volumes. I have written about half the first since\nI came home, and hope to be out in October.

I have not contradicted it publicly, nor shall I. When\nI tilt at such wringings out of the dirtiest mortality, I shall be another\nman--indeed, almost the creature they would make me.\n\nI gave your message to Forster, who sends a despatch-box full of kind\nremembrances in return. He is in a great state of delight with the first\nvolume of my American book (which I have just finished), and swears\nloudly by it. It is _True_ and Honourable I know, and I shall hope to\nsend it you, complete, by the first steamer in November.\n\nYour description of the porter and the carpet-bags prepares me for a\nfirst-rate facetious novel, brimful of the richest humour, on which I\nhave no doubt you are engaged. What is it called? Sometimes I imagine\nthe title-page thus:\n\n           OYSTERS\n\n             IN\n\n        EVERY STYLE\n\n             OR\n\n          OPENINGS\n\n             OF\n\n            LIFE\n\n             BY\n\n        YOUNG DANDO.\n\nAs to the man putting the luggage on his head, as a sort of sign, I\nadopt it from this hour.\n\nI date this from London, where I have come, as a good profligate,\ngraceless bachelor, for a day or two; leaving my wife and babbies at the\nseaside. . . . Heavens! if you were but here at this minute! A piece of\nsalmon and a steak are cooking in the kitchen; it's a very wet day, and\nI have had a fire lighted; the wine sparkles on a side table; the room\nlooks the more snug from being the only _un_dismantled one in the house;\nplates are warming for Forster and Maclise, whose knock I am momentarily\nexpecting; that groom I told you of, who never comes into the house,\nexcept when we are all out of town, is walking about in his\nshirt-sleeves without the smallest consciousness of impropriety; a great\nmound of proofs are waiting to be read aloud, after dinner. With what a\nshout I would clap you down into the easiest chair, my genial Felton, if\nyou could but appear, and order you a pair of slippers instantly!\n\nSince I have written this, the aforesaid groom--a very small man (as the\nfashion is), with fiery red hair (as the fashion is _not_)--has looked\nvery hard at me and fluttered about me at the same time, like a giant\nbutterfly. After a pause, he says, in a Sam Wellerish kind of way: \"I\nvent to the club this mornin', sir. There vorn't no letters, sir.\" \"Very\ngood, Topping.\" \"How's missis, sir?\" \"Pretty well, Topping.\" \"Glad to\nhear it, sir. _My_ missis ain't wery well, sir.\" \"No!\" \"No, sir, she's\na goin', sir, to have a hincrease wery soon, and it makes her rather\nnervous, sir; and ven a young voman gets at all down at sich a time,\nsir, she goes down wery deep, sir.\" To this sentiment I replied\naffirmatively, and then he adds, as he stirs the fire (as if he were\nthinking out loud): \"Wot a mystery it is! Wot a go is natur'!\" With\nwhich scrap of philosophy, he gradually gets nearer to the door, and so\nfades out of the room.\n\nThis same man asked me one day, soon after I came home, what Sir John\nWilson was. This is a friend of mine, who took our house and servants,\nand everything as it stood, during our absence in America. I told him an\nofficer. \"A wot, sir?\" \"An officer.\" And then, for fear he should think\nI meant a police-officer, I added, \"An officer in the army.\" \"I beg your\npardon, sir,\" he said, touching his hat, \"but the club as I always drove\nhim to wos the United Servants.\"\n\nThe real name of this club is the United Service, but I have no doubt he\nthought it was a high-life-below-stairs kind of resort, and that this\ngentleman was a retired butler or superannuated footman.\n\nThere's the knock, and the Great Western sails, or steams rather,\nto-morrow.

Now I am perfectly free from any diseased\ncuriosity in such respects, and whenever I hear of a notice of this\nkind, I never read it; whereby I always conceive (don't you?) that I get\nthe victory. With regard to your slave-owners, they may cry, till they\nare as black in the face as their own slaves, that Dickens lies. Dickens\ndoes not write for their satisfaction, and Dickens will not explain for\ntheir comfort. Dickens has the name and date of every newspaper in\nwhich every one of those advertisements appeared, as they know perfectly\nwell; but Dickens does not choose to give them, and will not at any time\nbetween this and the day of judgment. . . .\n\nI have been hard at work on my new book, of which the first number has\njust appeared. The Paul Joneses who pursue happiness and profit at other\nmen's cost will no doubt enable you to read it, almost as soon as you\nreceive this. I hope you will like it. And I particularly commend, my\ndear Felton, one Mr. Pecksniff and his daughters to your tender regards.\nI have a kind of liking for them myself.\n\nBlessed star of morning, such a trip as we had into Cornwall, just after\nLongfellow went away! The \"we\" means Forster, Maclise, Stanfield (the\nrenowned marine painter), and the Inimitable Boz. We went down into\nDevonshire by the railroad, and there we hired an open carriage from an\ninnkeeper, patriotic in all Pickwick matters, and went on with\npost-horses. Sometimes we travelled all night, sometimes all day,\nsometimes both. I kept the joint-stock purse, ordered all the dinners,\npaid all the turnpikes, conducted facetious conversations with the\npost-boys, and regulated the pace at which we travelled. Stanfield (an\nold sailor) consulted an enormous map on all disputed points of\nwayfaring; and referred, moreover, to a pocket-compass and other\nscientific instruments. The luggage was in Forster's department; and\nMaclise, having nothing particular to do, sang songs. Heavens! If you\ncould have seen the necks of bottles--distracting in their immense\nvarieties of shape--peering out of the carriage pockets! If you could\nhave witnessed the deep devotion of the post-boys, the wild attachment\nof the hostlers, the maniac glee of the waiters! If you could have\nfollowed us into the earthy old churches we visited, and into the\nstrange caverns on the gloomy sea-shore, and down into the depths of\nmines, and up to the tops of giddy heights where the unspeakably green\nwater was roaring, I don't know how many hundred feet below! If you\ncould have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which we sat in the\nbig rooms of ancient inns at night, until long after the small hours had\ncome and gone, or smelt but one steam of the hot punch (not white, dear\nFelton, like that amazing compound I sent you a taste of, but a rich,\ngenial, glowing brown) which came in every evening in a huge broad china\nbowl! I never laughed in my life as I did on this journey. It would have\ndone you good to hear me. I was choking and gasping and bursting the\nbuckle off the back of my stock, all the way. And Stanfield (who is very\nmuch of your figure and temperament, but fifteen years older) got into\nsuch apoplectic entanglements that we were often obliged to beat him on\nthe back with portmanteaus before we could recover him. Seriously, I do\nbelieve there never was such a trip. And they made such sketches, those\ntwo men, in the most romantic of our halting-places, that you would\nhave sworn we had the Spirit of Beauty with us, as well as the Spirit of\nFun. But stop till you come to England--I say no more.\n\nThe actuary of the national debt couldn't calculate the number of\nchildren who are coming here on Twelfth Night, in honour of Charley's\nbirthday, for which occasion I have provided a magic lantern and divers\nother tremendous engines of that nature. But the best of it is that\nForster and I have purchased between us the entire stock-in-trade of a\nconjurer, the practice and display whereof is intrusted to me. And O my\ndear eyes, Felton, if you could see me conjuring the company's watches\ninto impossible tea-caddies, and causing pieces of money to fly, and\nburning pocket-handkerchiefs without hurting 'em, and practising in my\nown room, without anybody to admire, you would never forget it as long\nas you live. In those tricks which require a confederate, I am assisted\n(by reason of his imperturbable good humour) by Stanfield, who always\ndoes his part exactly the wrong way, to the unspeakable delight of all\nbeholders. We come out on a small scale, to-night, at Forster's, where\nwe see the old year out and the new one in. Particulars shall be\nforwarded in my next.\n\nI have quite made up my mind that F---- really believes he _does_ know\nyou personally, and has all his life. He talks to me about you with such\ngravity that I am afraid to grin, and feel it necessary to look quite\nserious. Sometimes he _tells_ me things about you, doesn't ask me, you\nknow, so that I am occasionally perplexed beyond all telling, and begin\nto think it was he, and not I, who went to America. It's the queerest\nthing in the world.\n\nThe book I was to have given Longfellow for you is not worth sending by\nitself, being only a Barnaby. But I will look up some manuscript for you\n(I think I have that of the American Notes complete), and will try to\nmake the parcel better worth its long conveyance. With regard to\nMaclise's pictures, you certainly are quite right in your impression of\nthem; but he is \"such a discursive devil\" (as he says about himself) and\nflies off at such odd tangents, that I feel it difficult to convey to\nyou any general notion of his purpose. I will try to do so when I write\nagain. I want very much to know about ---- and that charming girl. . . .\nGive me full particulars. Will you remember me cordially to Sumner, and\nsay I thank him for his welcome letter? The like to Hillard, with many\nregards to himself and his wife, with whom I had one night a little\nconversation which I shall not readily forget. The like to Washington\nAllston, and all friends who care for me and have outlived my book. . . .\nAlways, my dear Felton,\n\n                                With true regard and affection, yours.",

I would on no account publish the\nletter you have sent me for that purpose, as I conceive that by doing\nso, I should not reciprocate the spirit in which you have written to me\nprivately. But if you should, upon consideration, think it not\ninexpedient to set the _Review_ right in regard to this point of fact,\nby a note in the next number, I should be glad to see it there.\n\nIn reference to the article itself, it did, by repeating this statement,\nhurt my feelings excessively; and is, in this respect, I still conceive,\nmost unworthy of its author. I am at a loss to divine who its author is.\nI _know_ he read in some cut-throat American paper, this and other\nmonstrous statements, which I could at any time have converted into\nsickening praise by the payment of some fifty dollars. I know that he is\nperfectly aware that his statement in the _Review_ in corroboration of\nthese lies, would be disseminated through the whole of the United\nStates; and that my contradiction will never be heard of. And though I\ncare very little for the opinion of any person who will set the\nstatement of an American editor (almost invariably an atrocious\nscoundrel) against my character and conduct, such as they may be; still,\nmy sense of justice does revolt from this most cavalier and careless\nexhibition of me to a whole people, as a traveller under false\npretences, and a disappointed intriguer. The better the acquaintance\nwith America, the more defenceless and more inexcusable such conduct is.\nFor, I solemnly declare (and appeal to any man but the writer of this\npaper, who has travelled in that country, for confirmation of my\nstatement) that the source from which he drew the \"information\" so\nrecklessly put forth again in England, is infinitely more obscene,\ndisgusting, and brutal than the very worst Sunday newspaper that has\never been printed in Great Britain. Conceive _The Edinburgh Review_\nquoting _The Satirist_, or _The Man about Town_, as an authority against\na man with one grain of honour, or feather-weight of reputation.\n\nWith regard to yourself, let me say again that I thank you with all\nsincerity and heartiness, and fully acquit you of anything but kind and\ngenerous intentions towards me. In proof of which, I do assure you that\nI am even more desirous than before to write for the _Review_, and to\nfind some topic which would at once please me and you.\n\n                                              Always faithfully yours.",

Up like a cork again, with _The North American Review_ in my\nhand. Like you, my dear ----, and I can say no more in praise of it,\nthough I go on to the end of the sheet. You cannot think how much notice\nit has attracted here. Brougham called the other day, with the number\n(thinking I might not have seen it), and I being out at the time, he\nleft a note, speaking of it, and of the writer, in terms that warmed my\nheart. Lord Ashburton (one of whose people wrote a notice in the\n_Edinburgh_ which they have since publicly contradicted) also wrote to\nme about it in just the same strain. And many others have done the like.\n\nI am in great health and spirits and powdering away at Chuzzlewit, with\nall manner of facetiousness rising up before me as I go on. As to news,\nI have really none, saving that ---- (who never took any exercise in his\nlife) has been laid up with rheumatism for weeks past, but is now, I\nhope, getting better. My little captain, as I call him--he who took me\nout, I mean, and with whom I had that adventure of the cork soles--has\nbeen in London too, and seeing all the lions under my escort. Good\nheavens! I wish you could have seen certain other mahogany-faced men\n(also captains) who used to call here for him in the morning, and bear\nhim off to docks and rivers and all sorts of queer places, whence he\nalways returned late at night, with rum-and-water tear-drops in his\neyes, and a complication of punchy smells in his mouth! He was better\nthan a comedy to us, having marvellous ways of tying his\npocket-handkerchief round his neck at dinner-time in a kind of jolly\nembarrassment, and then forgetting what he had done with it; also of\nsinging songs to wrong tunes, and calling land objects by sea names, and\nnever knowing what o'clock it was, but taking midnight for seven in the\nevening; with many other sailor oddities, all full of honesty,\nmanliness, and good temper. We took him to Drury Lane Theatre to see\n\"Much Ado About Nothing.\" But I never could find out what he meant by\nturning round, after he had watched the first two scenes with great\nattention, and inquiring \"whether it was a Polish piece.\" . . .\n\nOn the 4th of April I am going to preside at a public dinner for the\nbenefit of the printers; and if you were a guest at that table, wouldn't\nI smite you on the shoulder, harder than ever I rapped the well-beloved\nback of Washington Irving at the City Hotel in New York!\n\nYou were asking me--I love to say asking, as if we could talk\ntogether--about Maclise. He is such a discursive fellow, and so\neccentric in his might, that on a mental review of his pictures I can\nhardly tell you of them as leading to any one strong purpose. But the\nannual Exhibition of the Royal Academy comes off in May, and then I will\nendeavour to give you some notion of him. He is a tremendous creature,\nand might do anything. But, like all tremendous creatures, he takes his\nown way, and flies off at unexpected breaches in the conventional wall.\n\nYou know H----'s Book, I daresay. Ah! I saw a scene of mingled\ncomicality and seriousness at his funeral some weeks ago, which has\nchoked me at dinner-time ever since. C---- and I went as mourners; and\nas he lived, poor fellow, five miles out of town, I drove C---- down. It\nwas such a day as I hope, for the credit of nature, is seldom seen in\nany parts but these--muddy, foggy, wet, dark, cold, and unutterably\nwretched in every possible respect. Now, C---- has enormous whiskers,\nwhich straggle all down his throat in such weather, and stick out in\nfront of him, like a partially unravelled bird's-nest; so that he looks\nqueer enough at the best, but when he is very wet, and in a state\nbetween jollity (he is always very jolly with me) and the deepest\ngravity (going to a funeral, you know), it is utterly impossible to\nresist him; especially as he makes the strangest remarks the mind of man\ncan conceive, without any intention of being funny, but rather meaning\nto be philosophical. I really cried with an irresistible sense of his\ncomicality all the way; but when he was dressed out in a black cloak\nand a very long black hat-band by an undertaker (who, as he whispered me\nwith tears in his eyes--for he had known H---- many years--was a\n\"character, and he would like to sketch him\"), I thought I should have\nbeen obliged to go away. However, we went into a little parlour where\nthe funeral party was, and God knows it was miserable enough, for the\nwidow and children were crying bitterly in one corner, and the other\nmourners--mere people of ceremony, who cared no more for the dead man\nthan the hearse did--were talking quite coolly and carelessly together\nin another; and the contrast was as painful and distressing as anything\nI ever saw. There was an Independent clergyman present, with his bands\non and a bible under his arm, who, as soon as we were seated, addressed\n---- thus, in a loud emphatic voice: \"Mr. C----, have you seen a\nparagraph respecting our departed friend, which has gone the round of\nthe morning papers?\" \"Yes, sir,\" says C----, \"I have,\" looking very hard\nat me the while, for he had told me with some pride coming down that it\nwas his composition. \"Oh!\" said the clergyman. \"Then you will agree with\nme, Mr. C----, that it is not only an insult to me, who am the servant\nof the Almighty, but an insult to the Almighty, whose servant I am.\"\n\"How is that, sir?\" said C----. \"It is stated, Mr. C----, in that\nparagraph,\" says the minister, \"that when Mr. H---- failed in business\nas a bookseller, he was persuaded by _me_ to try the pulpit; which is\nfalse, incorrect, unchristian, in a manner blasphemous, and in all\nrespects contemptible. Let us pray.\" With which, my dear Felton, and in\nthe same breath, I give you my word, he knelt down, as we all did, and\nbegan a very miserable jumble of an extemporary prayer. I was really\npenetrated with sorrow for the family, but when C---- (upon his knees,\nand sobbing for the loss of an old friend) whispered me, \"that if that\nwasn't a clergyman, and it wasn't a funeral, he'd have punched his\nhead,\" I felt as if nothing but convulsions could possibly relieve\nme. . . .\n\n                                    Faithfully always, my dear Felton.",

HOGARTH,\n\nI was dressing to go to church yesterday morning--thinking, very sadly,\nof that time six years--when your kind note and its accompanying packet\nwere brought to me. The best portrait that was ever painted would be of\nlittle value to you and me, in comparison with that unfading picture we\nhave within us; and of the worst (which ----'s really is) I can only\nsay, that it has no interest in my eyes, beyond being something which\nshe sat near in its progress, full of life and beauty. In that light, I\nset some store by the copy you have sent me; and as a mark of your\naffection, I need not say I value it very much. As any record of that\ndear face, it is utterly worthless.\n\nI trace in many respects a strong resemblance between her mental\nfeatures and Georgina's--so strange a one, at times, that when she and\nKate and I are sitting together, I seem to think that what has happened\nis a melancholy dream from which I am just awakening. The perfect like\nof what she was, will never be again, but so much of her spirit shines\nout in this sister, that the old time comes back again at some seasons,\nand I can hardly separate it from the present.\n\nAfter she died, I dreamed of her every night for many months--I think\nfor the better part of a year--sometimes as a spirit, sometimes as a\nliving creature, never with any of the bitterness of my real sorrow, but\nalways with a kind of quiet happiness, which became so pleasant to me\nthat I never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back\nin one shape or other. And so it did. I went down into Yorkshire, and\nfinding it still present to me, in a strange scene and a strange bed, I\ncould not help mentioning the circumstance in a note I wrote home to\nKate. From that moment I have never dreamed of her once, though she is\nso much in my thoughts at all times (especially when I am successful,\nand have prospered in anything) that the recollection of her is an\nessential part of my being, and is as inseparable from my existence as\nthe beating of my heart is.\n\n                                                Always affectionately.",

But as I don't, I won't. Contenting myself with\nthis prediction, that one of these years and days, you will write or say\nto me: \"My dear Dickens, you were right, though rough, and did a world\nof good, though you got most thoroughly hated for it.\" To which I shall\nreply: \"My dear Felton, I looked a long way off and not immediately\nunder my nose.\" . . . At which sentiment you will laugh, and I shall\nlaugh; and then (for I foresee this will all happen in my land) we shall\ncall for another pot of porter and two or three dozen of oysters.\n\nNow, don't you in your own heart and soul quarrel with me for this long\nsilence? Not half so much as I quarrel with myself, I know; but if you\ncould read half the letters I write to you in imagination, you would\nswear by me for the best of correspondents. The truth is, that when I\nhave done my morning's work, down goes my pen, and from that minute I\nfeel it a positive impossibility to take it up again, until imaginary\nbutchers and bakers wave me to my desk. I walk about brimful of letters,\nfacetious descriptions, touching morsels, and pathetic friendships, but\ncan't for the soul of me uncork myself. The post-office is my rock\nahead. My average number of letters that _must_ be written every day is,\nat the least, a dozen. And you could no more know what I was writing to\nyou spiritually, from the perusal of the bodily thirteenth, than you\ncould tell from my hat what was going on in my head, or could read my\nheart on the surface of my flannel waistcoat.\n\nThis is a little fishing-place; intensely quiet; built on a cliff,\nwhereon--in the centre of a tiny semicircular bay--our house stands; the\nsea rolling and dashing under the windows. Seven miles out are the\nGoodwin Sands (you've heard of the Goodwin Sands?) whence floating\nlights perpetually wink after dark, as if they were carrying on\nintrigues with the servants. Also there is a big lighthouse called the\nNorth Foreland on a hill behind the village, a severe parsonic light,\nwhich reproves the young and giddy floaters, and stares grimly out upon\nthe sea. Under the cliff are rare good sands, where all the children\nassemble every morning and throw up impossible fortifications, which the\nsea throws down again at high water. Old gentlemen and ancient ladies\nflirt after their own manner in two reading-rooms and on a great many\nscattered seats in the open air. Other old gentlemen look all day\nthrough telescopes and never see anything. In a bay-window in a one-pair\nsits, from nine o'clock to one, a gentleman with rather long hair and no\nneckcloth, who writes and grins as if he thought he were very funny\nindeed. His name is Boz. At one he disappears, and presently emerges\nfrom a bathing-machine, and may be seen--a kind of salmon-coloured\nporpoise--splashing about in the ocean. After that he may be seen in\nanother bay-window on the ground-floor, eating a strong lunch; after\nthat, walking a dozen miles or so, or lying on his back in the sand\nreading a book. Nobody bothers him unless they know he is disposed to be\ntalked to; and I am told he is very comfortable indeed. He's as brown as\na berry, and they _do_ say is a small fortune to the innkeeper who sells\nbeer and cold punch. But this is mere rumour. Sometimes he goes up to\nLondon (eighty miles, or so, away), and then I'm told there is a sound\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields at night, as of men laughing, together with a\nclinking of knives and forks and wine-glasses.\n\nI never shall have been so near you since we parted aboard the _George\nWashington_ as next Tuesday. Forster, Maclise, and I, and perhaps\nStanfield, are then going aboard the Cunard steamer at Liverpool, to bid\nMacready good-bye, and bring his wife away. It will be a very hard\nparting. You will see and know him of course. We gave him a splendid\ndinner last Saturday at Richmond, whereat I presided with my accustomed\ngrace. He is one of the noblest fellows in the world, and I would give a\ngreat deal that you and I should sit beside each other to see him play\nVirginius, Lear, or Werner, which I take to be, every way, the greatest\npiece of exquisite perfection that his lofty art is capable of\nattaining. His Macbeth, especially the last act, is a tremendous\nreality; but so indeed is almost everything he does. You recollect,\nperhaps, that he was the guardian of our children while we were away. I\nlove him dearly. . . .\n\nYou asked me, long ago, about Maclise. He is such a wayward fellow in\nhis subjects, that it would be next to impossible to write such an\narticle as you were thinking of about him. I wish you could form an idea\nof his genius. One of these days a book will come out, \"Moore's Irish\nMelodies,\" entirely illustrated by him, on every page. _When_ it comes,\nI'll send it to you. You will have some notion of him then. He is in\ngreat favour with the Queen, and paints secret pictures for her to put\nupon her husband's table on the morning of his birthday, and the like.\nBut if he has a care, he will leave his mark on more enduring things\nthan palace walls.\n\nAnd so L---- is married. I remember _her_ well, and could draw her\nportrait, in words, to the life. A very beautiful and gentle creature,\nand a proper love for a poet. My cordial remembrances and\ncongratulations. Do they live in the house where we breakfasted? . . .\n\nI very often dream I am in America again; but, strange to say, I never\ndream of you. I am always endeavouring to get home in disguise, and have\na dreary sense of the distance. _\u00c0 propos_ of dreams, is it not a\nstrange thing if writers of fiction never dream of their own creations;\nrecollecting, I suppose, even in their dreams, that they have no real\nexistence? _I_ never dreamed of any of my own characters, and I feel it\nso impossible that I would wager Scott never did of his, real as they\nare. I had a good piece of absurdity in my head a night or two ago. I\ndreamed that somebody was dead. I don't know who, but it's not to the\npurpose. It was a private gentleman, and a particular friend; and I was\ngreatly overcome when the news was broken to me (very delicately) by a\ngentleman in a cocked hat, top boots, and a sheet. Nothing else. \"Good\nGod!\" I said, \"is he dead?\" \"He is as dead, sir,\" rejoined the\ngentleman, \"as a door-nail. But we must all die, Mr. Dickens, sooner or\nlater, my dear sir.\" \"Ah!\" I said. \"Yes, to be sure. Very true. But what\ndid he die of?\" The gentleman burst into a flood of tears, and said, in\na voice broken by emotion: \"He christened his youngest child, sir, with\na toasting-fork.\" I never in my life was so affected as at his having\nfallen a victim to this complaint. It carried a conviction to my mind\nthat he never could have recovered. I knew that it was the most\ninteresting and fatal malady in the world; and I wrung the gentleman's\nhand in a convulsion of respectful admiration, for I felt that this\nexplanation did equal honour to his head and heart!\n\nWhat do you think of Mrs. Gamp? And how do you like the undertaker? I\nhave a fancy that they are in your way. Oh heaven! such green woods as I\nwas rambling among down in Yorkshire, when I was getting that done last\nJuly! For days and weeks we never saw the sky but through green boughs;\nand all day long I cantered over such soft moss and turf, that the\nhorse's feet scarcely made a sound upon it. We have some friends in that\npart of the country (close to Castle Howard, where Lord Morpeth's father\ndwells in state, _in_ his park indeed), who are the jolliest of the\njolly, keeping a big old country house, with an ale cellar something\nlarger than a reasonable church, and everything, like Goldsmith's bear\ndances, \"in a concatenation accordingly.\" Just the place for you,\nFelton! We performed some madnesses there in the way of forfeits,\npicnics, rustic games, inspections of ancient monasteries at midnight,\nwhen the moon was shining, that would have gone to your heart, and, as\nMr. Weller says, \"come out on the other side.\" . . .\n\nWrite soon, my dear Felton; and if I write to you less often than I\nwould, believe that my affectionate heart is with you always. Loves and\nregards to all friends, from yours ever and ever.\n\n                                                Very faithfully yours.",

Would it meet the\npurposes of the _Review_ to come out strongly against any system of\neducation based exclusively on the principles of the Established Church?\nIf it would, I should like to show why such a thing as the Church\nCatechism is wholly inapplicable to the state of ignorance that now\nprevails; and why no system but one, so general in great religious\nprinciples as to include all creeds, can meet the wants and\nunderstandings of the dangerous classes of society. This is the only\nbroad ground I could hold, consistently with what I feel and think on\nsuch a subject. But I could give, in taking it, a description of certain\nvoluntary places of instruction, called \"the ragged schools,\" now\nexisting in London, and of the schools in jails, and of the ignorance\npresented in such places, which would make a very striking paper,\nespecially if they were put in strong comparison with the effort making,\nby subscription, to maintain exclusive Church instruction. I could show\nthese people in a state so miserable and so neglected, that their very\nnature rebels against the simplest religion, and that to convey to them\nthe faintest outlines of any system of distinction between right and\nwrong is in itself a giant's task, before which mysteries and squabbles\nfor forms _must_ give way. Would this be too much for the _Review_?\n\n                                                     Faithfully yours.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[19] This, and all other Letters addressed to Mr. Macvey Napier, were\nprinted in \"Selection from the Correspondence of the late Macvey Napier,\nEsq.,\" editor of _The Edinburgh Review_, edited by his son Macvey\nNapier.\n\n[20] His complaint was that the reviewer of his \"American Notes,\" in the\nnumber for January, 1843, had represented him as having gone to America\nas a missionary in the cause of international copyright--an allegation\nwhich Charles Dickens repudiated, and which was rectified in the way he\nhimself suggested.\n\n\n\n\n1844.",

And on the very day from which the\nnew year dates, I read your New Year congratulations as punctually as if\nyou lived in the next house. Why don't you?\n\nNow, if instantly on the receipt of this you will send a free and\nindependent citizen down to the Cunard wharf at Boston, you will find\nthat Captain Hewett, of the _Britannia_ steamship (my ship), has a small\nparcel for Professor Felton of Cambridge; and in that parcel you will\nfind a Christmas Carol in prose; being a short story of Christmas by\nCharles Dickens. Over which Christmas Carol Charles Dickens wept and\nlaughed and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary\nmanner in the composition; and thinking whereof he walked about the\nblack streets of London, fifteen and twenty miles many a night when all\nthe sober folks had gone to bed. . . . Its success is most prodigious.\nAnd by every post all manner of strangers write all manner of letters\nto him about their homes and hearths, and how this same Carol is read\naloud there, and kept on a little shelf by itself. Indeed, it is the\ngreatest success, as I am told, that this ruffian and rascal has ever\nachieved.\n\nForster is out again; and if he don't go in again, after the manner in\nwhich we have been keeping Christmas, he must be very strong indeed.\nSuch dinings, such dancings, such conjurings, such blindman's-buffings,\nsuch theatre-goings, such kissings-out of old years and kissings-in of\nnew ones, never took place in these parts before. To keep the Chuzzlewit\ngoing, and do this little book, the Carol, in the odd times between two\nparts of it, was, as you may suppose, pretty tight work. But when it was\ndone I broke out like a madman. And if you could have seen me at a\nchildren's party at Macready's the other night, going down a country\ndance with Mrs. M., you would have thought I was a country gentleman of\nindependent property, residing on a tiptop farm, with the wind blowing\nstraight in my face every day. . . .\n\nYour friend, Mr. P----, dined with us one day (I don't know whether I\ntold you this before), and pleased us very much. Mr. C---- has dined\nhere once, and spent an evening here. I have not seen him lately, though\nhe has called twice or thrice; for K---- being unwell and I busy, we\nhave not been visible at our accustomed seasons. I wonder whether H----\nhas fallen in your way. Poor H----! He was a good fellow, and has the\nmost grateful heart I ever met with. Our journeyings seem to be a dream\nnow. Talking of dreams, strange thoughts of Italy and France, and maybe\nGermany, are springing up within me as the Chuzzlewit clears off. It's a\nsecret I have hardly breathed to anyone, but I \"think\" of leaving\nEngland for a year, next midsummer, bag and baggage, little ones and\nall--then coming out with _such_ a story, Felton, all at once, no parts,\nsledgehammer blow.\n\nI send you a Manchester paper, as you desire. The report is not exactly\ndone, but very well done, notwithstanding. It was a very splendid sight,\nI assure you, and an awful-looking audience. I am going to preside at a\nsimilar meeting at Liverpool on the 26th of next month, and on my way\nhome I may be obliged to preside at another at Birmingham. I will send\nyou papers, if the reports be at all like the real thing.\n\nI wrote to Prescott about his book, with which I was perfectly charmed.\nI think his descriptions masterly, his style brilliant, his purpose\nmanly and gallant always. The introductory account of Aztec civilisation\nimpressed me exactly as it impressed you. From beginning to end the\nwhole history is enchanting and full of genius. I only wonder that,\nhaving such an opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of visible\njudgments, he never remarks, when Cortes and his men tumble the idols\ndown the temple steps and call upon the people to take notice that their\ngods are powerless to help themselves, that possibly if some intelligent\nnative had tumbled down the image of the Virgin or patron saint after\nthem nothing very remarkable might have ensued in consequence.\n\nOf course you like Macready. Your name's Felton. I wish you could see\nhim play Lear. It is stupendously terrible. But I suppose he would be\nslow to act it with the Boston company.\n\nHearty remembrances to Sumner, Longfellow, Prescott, and all whom you\nknow I love to remember. Countless happy years to you and yours, my dear\nFelton, and some instalment of them, however slight, in England, in the\nloving company of\n\n                               THE PROSCRIBED ONE.\n                                             Oh, breathe not his name!",

He introduced that about the\ngenie in the casket with marvellous effect; and was applauded to the\necho, which did applaud again.

A better and quicker audience never\nlistened to man.\n\nThe ladies had hung the hall (do you know what an immense place it is?)\nwith artificial flowers all round. And on the front of the great\ngallery, immediately fronting this young gentleman, were the words in\nartificial flowers (you'll observe) \"Welcome Boz\" in letters about six\nfeet high.

Don't believe them. I have written you, in\nintention, fifty letters, and I can claim no credit for anyone of them\n(though they were the best letters you ever read), for they all\noriginated in my desire to live in your memory and regard. Since I heard\nfrom Count D'Orsay, I have been beset in I don't know how many ways.\nFirst of all, I went to Marseilles and came back to Genoa. Then I moved\nto the Peschiere. Then some people, who had been present at the\nScientific Congress here, made a sudden inroad on that establishment,\nand overran it. Then they went away, and I shut myself up for a month,\nclose and tight, over my little Christmas book, \"The Chimes.\" All my\naffections and passions got twined and knotted up in it, and I became as\nhaggard as a murderer, long before I wrote \"The End.\" When I had done\nthat, like \"_The_ man of Thessaly,\" who having scratched his eyes out in\na quickset hedge, plunged into a bramble-bush to scratch them in again,\nI fled to Venice, to recover the composure I had disturbed. From thence\nI went to Verona and to Mantua. And now I am here--just come up from\nunderground, and earthy all over, from seeing that extraordinary tomb in\nwhich the dead saint lies in an alabaster case, with sparkling jewels\nall about him to mock his dusty eyes, not to mention the twenty-franc\npieces which devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of sky-light\nin the cathedral pavement above, as if it were the counter of his\nheavenly shop. You know Verona? You know everything in Italy, _I_ know.\nThe Roman Amphitheatre there delighted me beyond expression. I never saw\nanything so full of solemn ancient interest. There are the\nfour-and-forty rows of seats, as fresh and perfect as if their occupants\nhad vacated them but yesterday--the entrances, passages, dens, rooms,\ncorridors, the numbers over some of the arches. An equestrian troop had\nbeen there some days before, and had scooped out a little ring at one\nend of the arena, and had their performances in that spot. I should\nlike to have seen it, of all things, for its very dreariness. Fancy a\nhandful of people sprinkled over one corner of the great place (the\nwhole population of Verona wouldn't fill it now); and a spangled\ncavalier bowing to the echoes, and the grass-grown walls! I climbed to\nthe topmost seat, and looked away at the beautiful view for some\nminutes; when I turned round, and looked down into the theatre again, it\nhad exactly the appearance of an immense straw hat, to which the helmet\nin the Castle of Otranto was a baby; the rows of seats representing the\ndifferent plaits of straw, and the arena the inside of the crown. I had\ngreat expectations of Venice, but they fell immeasurably short of the\nwonderful reality. The short time I passed there went by me in a dream.\nI hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties, its sources of\ninterest, its uncommon novelty and freshness. A thousand and one\nrealisations of the Thousand and one Nights, could scarcely captivate\nand enchant me more than Venice.\n\nYour old house at Albaro--Il Paradiso--is spoken of as yours to this\nday. What a gallant place it is! I don't know the present inmate, but I\nhear that he bought and furnished it not long since, with great\nsplendour, in the French style, and that he wishes to sell it. I wish I\nwere rich and could buy it. There is a third-rate wine shop below\nByron's house, and the place looks dull and miserable, and ruinous\nenough. Old ---- is a trifle uglier than when I first arrived. He has\nperiodical parties, at which there are a great many flowerpots and a few\nices--no other refreshments. He goes about, constantly charged with\nextemporaneous poetry, and is always ready, like tavern dinners, on the\nshortest notice and the most reasonable terms. He keeps a gigantic harp\nin his bedroom, together with pen, ink, and paper, for fixing his ideas\nas they flow, a kind of profane King David, but truly good-natured and\nvery harmless.\n\nPray say to Count D'Orsay everything that is cordial and loving from me.\nThe travelling purse he gave me has been of immense service. It has been\nconstantly opened. All Italy seems to yearn to put its hand in it. I\nthink of hanging it, when I come back to England, on a nail as a trophy,\nand of gashing the brim like the blade of an old sword, and saying to my\nson and heir, as they do upon the stage: \"You see this notch, boy? Five\nhundred francs were laid low on that day, for post-horses. Where this\ngap is, a waiter charged your father treble the correct amount--and got\nit.

I write you my last Italian letter for this bout,\ndesigning to leave here, please God, on the ninth of next month, and to\nbe in London again by the end of June. I am looking forward with great\ndelight to the pleasure of seeing you once more, and mean to come to\nGore House with such a swoop as shall astonish the poodle, if, after\nbeing accustomed to his own size and sense, he retain the power of being\nastonished at anything in the wide world. You know where I have been,\nand every mile of ground I have travelled over, and every object I have\nseen. It is next to impossible, surely, to exaggerate the interest of\nRome; though, I think, it _is_ very possible to find the main source of\ninterest in the wrong things. Naples disappointed me greatly. The\nweather was bad during a great part of my stay there. But if I had not\nhad mud, I should have had dust, and though I had had sun, I must still\nhave had the Lazzaroni. And they are so ragged, so dirty, so abject, so\nfull of degradation, so sunken and steeped in the hopelessness of better\nthings, that they would make heaven uncomfortable, if they could ever\nget there. I didn't expect to see a handsome city, but I expected\nsomething better than that long dull line of squalid houses, which\nstretches from the Chiaja to the quarter of the Porta Capuana; and while\nI was quite prepared for a miserable populace, I had some dim belief\nthat there were bright rays among them, and dancing legs, and shining\nsun-browned faces. Whereas the honest truth is, that connected with\nNaples itself, I have not one solitary recollection. The country round\nit charmed me, I need not say. Who can forget Herculaneum and Pompeii?\n\nAs to Vesuvius, it burns away in my thoughts, beside the roaring waters\nof Niagara, and not a splash of the water extinguishes a spark of the\nfire; but there they go on, tumbling and flaming night and day, each in\nits fullest glory.\n\nI have seen so many wonders, and each of them has such a voice of its\nown, that I sit all day long listening to the roar they make as if it\nwere in a sea-shell, and have fallen into an idleness so complete, that\nI can't rouse myself sufficiently to go to Pisa on the twenty-fifth,\nwhen the triennial illumination of the Cathedral and Leaning Tower, and\nBridges, and what not, takes place. But I have already been there; and\nit cannot beat St. Peter's, I suppose. So I don't think I shall pluck\nmyself up by the roots, and go aboard a steamer for Leghorn. Let me\nthank you heartily for the \"Keepsake\" and the \"Book of Beauty.\" They\nreached me a week or two ago. I have been very much struck by two papers\nin them--one, Landor's \"Conversations,\" among the most charming,\nprofound, and delicate productions I have ever read; the other, your\nlines on Byron's room at Venice. I am as sure that you wrote them from\nyour heart, as I am that they found their way immediately to mine.\n\nIt delights me to receive such accounts of Maclise's fresco. If he will\nonly give his magnificent genius fair play, there is not enough cant and\ndulness even in the criticism of art from which Sterne prayed kind\nheaven to defend him, as the worst of all the cants continually canted\nin this canting world--to keep the giant down an hour.\n\nOur poor friend, the naval governor,[25] has lost his wife, I am sorry\nto hear, since you and I spoke of his pleasant face. Do not let your\nnieces forget me, if you can help it, and give my love to Count D'Orsay,\nwith many thanks to him for his charming letter. I was greatly amused by\nhis account of ----. There was a cold shade of aristocracy about it, and\na dampness of cold water, which entertained me beyond measure.\n\n                                              Always faithfully yours.",

I think I could write a pretty good and a well-timed\narticle on the _Punishment of Death_, and sympathy with great criminals,\ninstancing the gross and depraved curiosity that exists in reference to\nthem, by some of the outrageous things that were written, done, and said\nin recent cases. But as I am not sure that my views would be yours, and\nas their statement would be quite inseparable from such a paper, I will\nbriefly set down their purport that you may decide for yourself.\n\nSociety, having arrived at that state in which it spares bodily torture\nto the worst criminals, and having agreed, if criminals be put to death\nat all, to kill them in the speediest way, I consider the question with\nreference to society, and not at all with reference to the criminal,\nholding that, in a case of cruel and deliberate murder, he is already\nmercifully and sparingly treated. But, as a question for the deliberate\nconsideration of all reflective persons, I put this view of the case.\nWith such very repulsive and odious details before us, may it not be\nwell to inquire whether the punishment of death be beneficial to\nsociety? I believe it to have a horrible fascination for many of those\npersons who render themselves liable to it, impelling them onward to the\nacquisition of a frightful notoriety; and (setting aside the strong\nconfirmation of this idea afforded in individual instances) I presume\nthis to be the case in very badly regulated minds, when I observe the\nstrange fascination which everything connected with this punishment, or\nthe object of it, possesses for tens of thousands of decent, virtuous,\nwell-conducted people, who are quite unable to resist the published\nportraits, letters, anecdotes, smilings, snuff-takings, of the bloodiest\nand most unnatural scoundrel with the gallows before him. I observe that\nthis strange interest does not prevail to anything like the same degree\nwhere death is not the penalty. Therefore I connect it with the dread\nand mystery surrounding death in any shape, but especially in this\navenging form, and am disposed to come to the conclusion that it\nproduces crime in the criminally disposed, and engenders a diseased\nsympathy--morbid and bad, but natural and often irresistible--among the\nwell-conducted and gentle. Regarding it as doing harm to both these\nclasses, it may even then be right to inquire, whether it has any\nsalutary influence on those small knots and specks of people, mere\nbubbles in the living ocean, who actually behold its infliction with\ntheir proper eyes. On this head it is scarcely possible to entertain a\ndoubt, for we know that robbery, and obscenity, and callous indifference\nare of no commoner occurrence anywhere than at the foot of the scaffold.\nFurthermore, we know that all exhibitions of agony and death have a\ntendency to brutalise and harden the feelings of men, and have always\nbeen the most rife among the fiercest people. Again, it is a great\nquestion whether ignorant and dissolute persons (ever the great body of\nspectators, as few others will attend), seeing _that_ murder done, and\nnot having seen the other, will not, almost of necessity, sympathise\nwith the man who dies before them, especially as he is shown, a martyr\nto their fancy, tied and bound, alone among scores, with every kind of\nodds against him.\n\nI should take all these threads up at the end by a vivid little sketch\nof the origin and progress of such a crime as Hooker's, stating a\nsomewhat parallel case, but an imaginary one, pursuing its hero to his\ndeath, and showing what enormous harm he does _after_ the crime for\nwhich he suffers. I should state none of these positions in a positive\nsledge-hammer way, but tempt and lure the reader into the discussion of\nthem in his own mind; and so we come to this at last--whether it be for\nthe benefit of society to elevate even this crime to the awful dignity\nand notoriety of death; and whether it would not be much more to its\nadvantage to substitute a mean and shameful punishment, degrading the\ndeed and the committer of the deed, and leaving the general compassion\nto expend itself upon the only theme at present quite forgotten in the\nhistory, that is to say, the murdered person.\n\nI do not give you this as an outline of the paper, which I think I could\nmake attractive. It is merely an exposition of the inferences to which\nits whole philosophy must tend.\n\n                                              Always faithfully yours.",

We had a pleasant\nand prosperous journey, having rather cold weather in Switzerland and on\nthe borders thereof, and a slight detention of three hours and a half at\nthe frontier Custom House, atop of a mountain, in a hard frost and a\ndense fog. We came into this house last Thursday. It has a pretty\ndrawing-room, approached through four most extraordinary chambers. It is\nthe most ridiculous and preposterous house in the world, I should think.\nIt belongs to a Marquis Castellane, but was fitted (so Paul Pry Poole\nsaid, who dined here yesterday) by ---- in a fit of temporary insanity,\nI have no doubt. The dining-room is mere midsummer madness, and is\ndesigned to represent a bosky grove.\n\nAt this present writing, snow is falling in the street, and the weather\nis very cold, but not so cold as it was yesterday. I dined with Lord\nNormanby on Sunday last. Everything seems to be queer and uncomfortable\nin the diplomatic way, and he is rather bothered and worried, to my\nthinking. I found young Sheridan (Mrs. Norton's brother) the attach\u00e9. I\nknow him very well, and he is a good man for my sight-seeing purposes.\nThere are to be no theatricals unless the times should so adjust\nthemselves as to admit of their being French, to which the Markis seems\nto incline, as a bit of conciliation and a popular move.\n\nLumley, of Italian opera notoriety, also dined here yesterday, and seems\nhugely afeard of the opposition opera at Covent Garden, who have already\nspirited away Grisi and Mario, which he affects to consider a great\ncomfort and relief. I gave him some uncompromising information on the\nsubject of his pit, and told him that if he didn't conciliate the middle\nclasses, he might depend on being damaged, very decidedly. The danger of\nthe Covent Garden enterprise seems to me to be that they are going in\nfor ballet too, and I really don't think the house is large enough to\nrepay the double expense.\n\nForster writes me that Mac has come out with tremendous vigour in the\nChristmas Book, and took off his coat at it with a burst of such\nalarming energy that he has done four subjects! Stanfield has done\nthree. Keeleys are making that \"change\"[30] I was so hot upon at\nLausanne, and seem ready to spend money with bold hearts, but the cast\n(as far as I know it, at present) would appear to be black despair and\nmoody madness. J. W. Leigh Murray, from the Princess's, is to be the\nAlfred, and Forster says there is a Mrs. Gordon at Bolton's who must be\ngot for Grace. I am horribly afraid ---- will do one of the lawyers, and\nthere seems to be nobody but ---- for Marion. I shall run over and carry\nconsternation into the establishment, as soon as I have done the number.\nBut I have not begun it yet, though I hope to do so to-night, having\nbeen quite put out by chopping and changing about, and by a vile touch\nof biliousness, that makes my eyes feel as if they were yellow bullets.\n\"Dombey\" has passed its thirty thousand already. Do you remember a\nmysterious man in a straw hat low-crowned, and a Petersham coat, who was\na sort of manager or amateur man-servant at Miss Kelly's? Mr. Baynton\nBolt, sir, came out, the other night, as Macbeth, at the Royal Surrey\nTheatre.\n\nThere's all my news for you! Let me know, in return, whether you have\nfought a duel yet with your milingtary landlord, and whether Lausanne is\nstill that giddy whirl of dissipation it was wont to be, also full\nparticulars of your fairer and better half, and of the baby. I will send\na Christmas book to Clermont as soon as I get any copies. And so no more\nat present from yours ever.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[27] Mr. W. J.

He has been now at Versailles, now in the prisons, now at\nthe opera, now at the hospitals, now at the Conservatoire, and now at\nthe Morgue, with a dreadful insatiability. I begin to doubt whether I\nhad anything to do with a book called \"Dombey,\" or ever sat over number\nfive (not finished a fortnight yet) day after day, until I half began,\nlike the monk in poor Wilkie's story, to think it the only reality in\nlife, and to mistake all the realities for short-lived shadows.\n\nAmong the multitude of sights, we saw our pleasant little bud of a\nfriend, Rose Ch\u00e9ri, play Clarissa Harlowe the other night. I believe she\ndoes it in London just now, and perhaps you may have seen it. A most\ncharming, intelligent, modest, affecting piece of acting it is, with a\ndeath superior to anything I ever saw on the stage, except Macready's\nLear. The theatres are admirable just now. We saw \"Gentil Bernard\" at\nthe Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s last night, acted in a manner that was absolutely perfect.\nIt was a little picture of Watteau, animated and talking from beginning\nto end. At the Cirque there is a new show-piece called the \"French\nRevolution,\" in which there is a representation of the National\nConvention, and a series of battles (fought by some five hundred people,\nwho look like five thousand) that are wonderful in their extraordinary\nvigour and truth. Gun-cotton gives its name to the general annual jocose\nreview at the Palais Royal, which is dull enough, saving for the\nintroduction of Alexandre Dumas, sitting in his study beside a pile of\nquarto volumes about five feet high, which he says is the first tableau\nof the first act of the first piece to be played on the first night of\nhis new theatre. The revival of Moli\u00e8re's \"Don Juan,\" at the Fran\u00e7ais,\nhas drawn money. It is excellently played, and it is curious to observe\nhow different _their_ Don Juan and valet are from our English ideas of\nthe master and man. They are playing \"Lucretia Borgia\" again at the\nPorte St. Martin, but it is poorly performed and hangs fire drearily,\nthough a very remarkable and striking play. We were at Victor Hugo's\nhouse last Sunday week, a most extraordinary place, looking like an old\ncuriosity shop, or the property-room of some gloomy, vast, old theatre.\nI was much struck by Hugo himself, who looks like a genius as he is,\nevery inch of him, and is very interesting and satisfactory from head to\nfoot. His wife is a handsome woman, with flashing black eyes. There is\nalso a charming ditto daughter of fifteen or sixteen, with ditto eyes.\nSitting among old armour and old tapestry, and old coffers, and grim old\nchairs and tables, and old canopies of state from old palaces, and old\ngolden lions going to play at skittles with ponderous old golden balls,\nthey made a most romantic show and looked like a chapter out of one of\nhis own books.",

It is believed that such\na demonstration by literature on behalf of literature, and such a mark\nof sympathy by authors and artists, for one who has written so well,\nwould be of more service, present and prospective, to Hunt than almost\nany other means of help that could be devised. And we know, from\nhimself, that it would be most gratifying to his own feelings.\n\nThe arrangements are, as yet, in an imperfect state; for the date of\ntheir being carried out depends on our being able to get one of the\nlarge theatres before the close of the present London season. In the\nevent of our succeeding, we purpose acting in London, on Wednesday the\n14th of July, and on Monday the 19th. On the first occasion we shall\nplay \"Every Man in His Humour,\" and a farce; on the second, \"The Merry\nWives of Windsor,\" and a farce.\n\nBut we do not intend to stop here. Believing that Leigh Hunt has done\nmore to instruct the young men of England, and to lend a helping hand to\nthose who educate themselves, than any writer in England, we are\nresolved to come down, in a body, to Liverpool and Manchester, and to\nact one night at each place. And the object of my letter is, to ask you,\nas the representative of the great educational establishment of\nLiverpool, whether we can count on your active assistance; whether you\nwill form a committee to advance our object; and whether, if we send you\nour circulars and addresses, you will endeavour to secure us a full\ntheatre, and to enlist the general sympathy and interest in behalf of\nthe cause we have at heart?\n\nI address, by this post, a letter, which is almost the counterpart of\nthe present, to the honorary secretaries of the Manchester Athen\u00e6um. If\nwe find in both towns such a response as we confidently expect, I would\npropose, on behalf of my friends, that the Liverpool and Manchester\nInstitutions should decide for us, at which town we shall first appear,\nand which play we shall act in each place.\n\nI forbear entering into any more details, however, until I am favoured\nwith your reply.\n\n                          Always believe me, my dear Sir,\n                                               faithfully your Friend.",

I cannot praise it better or more appropriately than by saying it\nis in Hunt's own spirit, and most charmingly expressed. I had the most\nsincere and hearty pleasure in reading it.[34]\n\nYour announcement of \"The Working Man's Life\" had attracted my attention\nby reason of the title, which had a great interest for me.[35] I hardly\nknow if there is something wanting to my fancy in a certain genuine\nsimple air I had looked for in the first part. But there is great\npromise in it, and I shall be earnest to know how it proceeds.\n\nNow, to leave these pleasant matters, and resume my managerial\ncharacter, which I shall be heartily glad (between ourselves) to lay\ndown again, though I have none but pleasant correspondents, and the most\neasily governable company of actors on earth.\n\nI have written to Mr. Robinson by this post that I wish these words,\nfrom our original London circular, to stand at top of the bills, after\n\"For the Benefit of Mr. Leigh Hunt\":\n\n\"It is proposed to devote a portion of the proceeds of this benefit to\nthe assistance of another celebrated writer, whose literary career is at\nan end, and who has no provision for the decline of his life.\"\n\nI have also told him that there is no objection to its being known that\nthis is Mr. Poole, the author of \"Paul Pry,\" and \"Little Pedlington,\"\nand many comic pieces of great merit, and whose farce of \"Turning the\nTables\" we mean to finish with in Manchester. Beyond what he will get\nfrom these benefits, he has no resource in this wide world, _I know_.\nThere are reasons which make it desirable to get this fact abroad, and\nif you see no objection to paragraphing it at your office (sending the\nparagraph round, if you should please, to the other Manchester papers),\nI should be much obliged to you.\n\nYou may like to know, as a means of engendering a more complete\nindividual interest in our actors, who they are. Jerrold and myself you\nhave heard of; Mr. George Cruikshank and Mr. Leech (the best\ncaricaturists of any time perhaps) need no introduction. Mr. Frank Stone\n(a Manchester man) and Mr. Egg are artists of high reputation. Mr.\nForster is the critic of _The Examiner_, the author of \"The Lives of the\nStatesmen of the Commonwealth,\" and very distinguished as a writer in\n_The Edinburgh Review_. Mr. Lewes is also a man of great attainments in\npolite literature, and the author of a novel published not long since,\ncalled \"Ranthorpe.\" Mr. Costello is a periodical writer, and a gentleman\nrenowned as a tourist. Mr. Mark Lemon is a dramatic author, and the\neditor of _Punch_--a most excellent actor, as you will find. My brothers\nplay small parts, for love, and have no greater note than the Treasury\nand the City confer on their disciples. Mr. Thompson is a private\ngentleman. You may know all this, but I thought it possible you might\nlike to hold the key to our full company.

Do you think the\nManchester people would be equally glad to see us again, and that the\nhouse could be filled, as before, at our old prices? _If yes, would you\nand our other friends go, at once, to work in the cause?_ The only night\non which we could play in Manchester would be Saturday, the 3rd of June.\nIt is possible that the depression of the times may render a performance\nin Manchester unwise.

A real house like this is\ninsupportable, after that canvas farm wherein I was so happy.

King.[43]]\n\n                   DEVONSHIRE TERRACE, _Saturday, December 1st, 1849._\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nI hasten to let you know what took place at Eton to-day. I found that I\n_did_ stand in some sort committed to Mr. Evans, though not so much so\nbut that I could with perfect ease have declined to place Charley in his\nhouse if I had desired to do so. I must say, however, that after seeing\nMr. Cookesley (a most excellent man in his way) and seeing Mr. Evans,\nand Mr. Evans's house, I think I should, under any circumstances, have\ngiven the latter the preference as to the domestic part of Charley's\nlife. I would certainly prefer to try it. I therefore thought it best to\npropose to have Mr. Cookesley for his tutor, and to place him as a\nboarder with Mr. Evans. Both gentlemen seemed satisfied with this\narrangement, and Dr. Hawtrey expressed his approval of it also.\n\nMr. Cookesley, wishing to know what Charley could do, asked me if I\nwould object to leaving him there for half-an-hour or so. As Charley\nappeared not at all afraid of this proposal, I left him then and there.\nOn my return, Mr. Cookesley said, in high and unqualified terms, that he\nhad been thoroughly well grounded and well taught--that he had examined\nhim in Virgil and Herodotus, and that he not only knew what he was about\nperfectly well, but showed an intelligence in reference to those authors\nwhich did his tutor great credit. He really appeared most interested and\npleased, and filled me with a grateful feeling towards you, to whom\nCharley owes so much.\n\nHe said there were certain verses in imitation of Horace (I really\nforget what sort of verses) to which Charley was unaccustomed, and which\nwere a little matter enough in themselves, but were made a great point\nof at Eton, and could be got up well in a month \"_from an Old Etonian_.\"\nFor this purpose he would desire Charley to be sent every day to a\ncertain Mr. Hardisty, in Store Street, Bedford Square, to whom he had\nalready (in my absence) prepared a note. Between ourselves, I must not\nhesitate to tell you plainly that this appeared to me to be a\nconventional way of bestowing a little patronage. But, of course, I had\nnothing for it but to say it should be done; upon which, Mr. Cookesley\nadded that he was then certain that Charley, on coming after the\nChristmas holidays, would be placed at once in \"the remove,\" which\nseemed to surprise Mr. Evans when I afterwards told him of it as a high\nstation.\n\nI will take him to this gentleman on Monday, and arrange for his going\nthere every day; but, if you will not object, I should still like him to\nremain with you, and to have the advantage of preparing these annoying\nverses under your eye until the holidays. That Mr. Cookesley may have\nhis own way thoroughly, I will send Charley to Mr. Hardisty daily until\nthe school at Eton recommences.\n\nLet me impress upon you in the strongest manner, not only that I was\ninexpressibly delighted myself by the readiness with which Charley went\nthrough this ordeal with a stranger, but that I also saw you would have\nbeen well pleased and much gratified if you could have seen Mr.\nCookesley afterwards. He had evidently not expected such a result, and\ntook it as not at all an ordinary one.\n\n                            My dear Sir, yours faithfully and obliged.",

I had gone down to Forster, comedy in\nhand.\n\nI think it _most admirable_.[44] Full of character, strong in interest,\nrich in capital situations, and _certain to go nobly_. You know how\nhighly I thought of \"Money,\" but I sincerely think these three acts\nfiner. I did not think of the slight suggestions you make, but I said,\n_en passant_, that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the\nstage a little concentrated. I don't believe it would require even that,\nwith the leading-up which you propose. I cannot say too much of the\ncomedy to express what I think and feel concerning it; and I look at it,\ntoo, remember, with the yellow eye of an actor! I should have taken to\nit (need I say so!) _con amore_ in any case, but I should have been\njealous of your reputation, exactly as I appreciate your generosity. If\nI had a misgiving of ten lines I should have scrupulously mentioned it.\n\nStone will take the Duke capitally; and I will answer for his being got\ninto doing it _very well_. Looking down the perspective of a few winter\nevenings here, I am confident about him. Forster will be thoroughly\nsound and real. Lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy on\nthe stage, that I don't think any actor could touch his part as he will;\nand I hope you will have opportunities of testing the accuracy of this\nprediction. Egg ought to do the Author to absolute perfection. As to\nJerrold--there he stands in the play! I would propose Leech (well made\nup) for Easy. He is a good name, and I see nothing else for him.\n\nThis brings me to my own part. If we had anyone, or could get anyone,\nfor Wilmot, I could do (I think) something so near your meaning in Sir\nGilbert, that I let him go with a pang. Assumption has charms for me--I\nhardly know for how many wild reasons--so delightful, that I feel a loss\nof, oh! I can't say what exquisite foolery, when I lose a chance of\nbeing someone in voice, etc., not at all like myself. But--I speak quite\nfreely, knowing you will not mistake me--I know from experience that we\ncould find nobody to hold the play together in Wilmot if I didn't do it.\nI think I could touch the gallant, generous, careless pretence, with the\nreal man at the bottom of it, so as to take the audience with him from\nthe first scene. I am quite sure I understand your meaning; and I am\nabsolutely certain that as Jerrold, Forster, and Stone came in, I could,\nas a mere little bit of mechanics, present them better by doing that\npart, and paying as much attention to their points as my own, than\nanother amateur actor could. Therefore I throw up my cap for Wilmot, and\nhereby devote myself to him, heart and head!\n\nI ought to tell you that in a play we once rehearsed and never played\n(but rehearsed several times, and very carefully), I saw Lemon do a\npiece of reality with a rugged pathos in it, which I felt, as I stood on\nthe stage with him to be extraordinarily good. In the serious part of\nSir Gilbert he will surprise you. And he has an intuitive discrimination\nin such things which will just keep the suspicious part from being too\ndroll at the outset--which will just show a glimpse of something in the\ndepths of it.\n\nThe moment I come back to town (within a fortnight, please God!) I will\nascertain from Forster where you are. Then I will propose to you that we\ncall our company together, agree upon one general plan of action, and\nthat you and I immediately begin to see and book our Vice-Presidents,\netc. Further, I think we ought to see about the Queen. I would suggest\nour playing first about three weeks before the opening of the\nExhibition, in order that it may be the town talk before the country\npeople and foreigners come. Macready thinks with me that a very large\nsum of money may be got in London.\n\nI propose (for cheapness and many other considerations) to make a\ntheatre expressly for the purpose, which we can put up and take\ndown--say in the Hanover Square Rooms--and move into the country. As\nWatson wanted something of a theatre made for his forthcoming Little Go,\nI have made it a sort of model of what I mean, and shall be able to test\nits working powers before I see you. Many things that, for portability,\nwere to be avoided in Mr. Hewitt's theatre, I have replaced with less\nexpensive and weighty contrivances.\n\nNow, my dear Bulwer, I have come to the small hours, and am writing\nalone here, as if _I_ were writing something to do what your comedy\nwill. At such a time the temptation is strong upon me to say a great\ndeal more, but I will only say this--in mercy to you--that I do devoutly\nbelieve that this plan carried, will entirely change the status of the\nliterary man in England, and make a revolution in his position, which no\nGovernment, no power on earth but his own, could ever effect. I have\nimplicit confidence in the scheme--so splendidly begun--if we carry it\nout with a steadfast energy. I have a strong conviction that we hold in\nour hands the peace and honour of men of letters for centuries to come,\nand that you are destined to be their best and most enduring benefactor.\n\nOh! what a procession of New Years might walk out of all this, after we\nare very dusty!\n\n                                                Ever yours faithfully.\n\nP.S.--I have forgotten something.

I think I can relieve your mind completely.\n\nThe Duke has read the play. He asked for it a week ago, and had it. He\nhas been at Brighton since. He called here before eleven on Saturday\nmorning, but I was out on the play business, so I went to him at\nDevonshire House yesterday. He almost knows the play by heart. He is\nsupremely delighted with it, and critically understands it. In proof of\nthe latter part of this sentence I may mention that he had made two or\nthree memoranda of trivial doubtful points, _every one of which had\nattracted our attention in rehearsal_, as I found when he showed them to\nme. He thoroughly understands and appreciates the comedy of the\nDuke--threw himself back in his chair and laughed, as I say of Walpole,\n\"till I thought he'd have choked,\" about his first Duchess, who was a\nPercy. He suggested that he shouldn't say: \"You know how to speak to the\nheart of a Noble,\" because it was not likely that he would call himself\na Noble. He thought we might close up the Porter and Softhead a little\nmore (already done) and was so charmed and delighted to recall the\ncomedy that he was more pleased than any boy you ever saw when I\nrepeated two or three of the speeches in my part for him. He is coming\nto the rehearsal to-day (we rehearse now at Devonshire House, three days\na-week, all day long), and, since he read the play, has conceived a most\nmagnificent and noble improvement in the Devonshire House plan, by\nwhich, I daresay, we shall get another thousand or fifteen hundred\npounds. There is not a grain of distrust or doubt in him. I am perfectly\ncertain that he would confide to me, and does confide to me, his whole\nmind on the subject.\n\nMore than this, the Duke comes out the best man in the play. I am happy\nto report to you that Stone does the honourable manly side of that\npride inexpressibly better than I should have supposed possible in him.\nThe scene where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is\n_certain_ to be an effect. He is _not_ a jest upon the order of Dukes,\nbut a great tribute to them. I have sat looking at the play (as you may\nsuppose) pretty often, and carefully weighing every syllable of it. I\nsee, in the Duke, the most estimable character in the piece. I am as\nsure that I represent the audience in this as I am that I hear the words\nwhen they are spoken before me. The first time that scene with Hardman\nwas seriously done, it made an effect on the company that quite\nsurprised and delighted me; and whenever and wherever it is done (but\nmost of all at Devonshire House) the result will be the same.\n\nEveryone is greatly improved. I wrote an earnest note to Forster a few\ndays ago on the subject of his being too loud and violent. He has since\nsubdued himself with the most admirable pains, and improved the part a\nthousand per cent. All the points are gradually being worked and\nsmoothed out with the utmost neatness all through the play. They are all\nmost heartily anxious and earnest, and, upon the least hitch, will do\nthe same thing twenty times over. The scenery, furniture, etc., are\nrapidly advancing towards completion, and will be beautiful. The dresses\nare a perfect blaze of colour, and there is not a pocket-flap or a scrap\nof lace that has not been made according to Egg's drawings to the\nquarter of an inch. Every wig has been made from an old print or\npicture. From the Duke's snuff-box to Will's Coffee-house, you will\nfind everything in perfect truth and keeping. I have resolved that\nwhenever we come to a weak place in the acting, it must, somehow or\nother, be made a strong one. The places that I used to be most afraid of\nare among the best points now.\n\nWill you come to the dress rehearsal on the Tuesday evening before the\nQueen's night? There will be no one present but the Duke.\n\nI write in the greatest haste, for the rehearsal time is close at hand,\nand I have the master carpenter and gasman to see before we begin.\n\nMiss Coutts is one of the most sensible of women, and if I had not seen\nthe Duke yesterday, I would have shown her the play directly. But there\ncan't be any room for anxiety on the head that has troubled you so much.\nYou may clear it from your mind as completely as Gunpowder Plot.\n\n                                       In great haste, ever cordially.",

Allowing for the necessarily heavy expenses of all kinds, I\nbelieve we can hardly fund less than a Thousand Pounds out of this trip\nalone. And, more than that, the extraordinary interest taken in the idea\nof the Guild by \"this grand people of England\" down in these vast hives,\nand the enthusiastic welcome they give it, assure me that we may do what\nwe will if we will only be true and faithful to our design. There is a\nsocial recognition of it which I cannot give you the least idea of. I\nsincerely believe that we have the ball at our feet, and may throw it up\nto the very Heaven of Heavens. And I don't speak for myself alone, but\nfor all our people, and not least of all for Forster, who has been\nabsolutely stunned by the tremendous earnestness of these great places.\n\nTo tell you (especially after your affectionate letter) what I would\nhave given to have had you there would be idle. But I can most seriously\nsay that all the sights of the earth turned pale in my eyes, before the\nsight of three thousand people with one heart among them, and no\ncapacity in them, in spite of all their efforts, of sufficiently\ntestifying to you how they believe you to be right, and feel that they\ncannot do enough to cheer you on. They understood the play (_far better\nacted by this time than ever you have seen it_) as well as you do. They\nallowed nothing to escape them. They rose up, when it was over, with a\nperfect fury of delight, and the Manchester people sent a requisition\nafter us to Liverpool to say that if we will go back there in May, when\nwe act at Birmingham (as of course we shall) they will joyfully\nundertake to fill the Free Trade Hall again. Among the Tories of\nLiverpool the reception was equally enthusiastic. We played, two nights\nrunning, to a hall crowded to the roof--more like the opera at Genoa or\nMilan than anything else I can compare it to. We dined at the Town Hall\nmagnificently, and it made no difference in the response. I said what we\nwere quietly determined to do (when the Guild was given as the toast of\nthe night), and really they were so noble and generous in their\nencouragement that I should have been more ashamed of myself than I hope\nI ever shall be, if I could have felt conscious of having ever for a\nmoment faltered in the work.\n\nI will answer for Birmingham--for any great working town to which we\nchose to go. We have won a position for the idea which years upon years\nof labour could not have given it. I believe its worldly fortunes have\nbeen advanced in this last week fifty years at least. I feebly express\nto you what Forster (who couldn't be at Liverpool, and has not those\nshouts ringing in his ears) has felt from the moment he set foot in\nManchester. Believe me we may carry a perfect fiery cross through the\nNorth of England, and over the Border, in this cause, if need be--not\nonly to the enrichment of the cause, but to the lasting enlistment of\nthe people's sympathy.\n\nI have been so happy in all this that I could have cried on the shortest\nnotice any time since Tuesday. And I do believe that our whole body\nwould have gone to the North Pole with me if I had shown them good\nreason for it.\n\nI hope I am not so tired but that you may be able to read this. I have\nbeen at it almost incessantly, day and night for a week, and I am afraid\nmy handwriting suffers. But in all other respects I am only a giant\nrefreshed.\n\nWe meet next Saturday you recollect?

The paper really is, like\nthe celebrated ambassadorial appointment, \"too bad.\"\n\n\"A Doctor of Morals,\" _impossible of insertion as it stands_. A mere\npuff, with all the difficult facts of the question blinked, and many\nstatements utterly at variance with what I am known to have written. It\nis exactly because the great bulk of offences in a great number of\nplaces are committed by professed thieves, that it will not do to have\npet prisoning advocated without grave remonstrance and great care. That\nclass of prisoner is not to be reformed. We must begin at the beginning\nand prevent, by stringent correction and supervision of wicked parents,\nthat class of prisoner from being regularly supplied as if he were a\nhuman necessity.\n\nDo they teach trades in workhouses and try to fit _their_ people (the\nworst part of them) for society? Come with me to Tothill Fields\nBridewell, and I will show you what a workhouse girl is. Or look to my\n\"Walk in a Workhouse\" (in \"H. W.\") and to the glance at the youths I saw\nin one place positively kept like wolves.\n\nMr. ---- thinks prisons could be made nearly self-supporting. Have you\nany idea of the difficulty that is found in disposing of Prison-work, or\ndoes he think that the Treadmills didn't grind the air because the State\nor the Magistracy objected to the competition of prison-labour with\nfree-labour, but because the work _could not be got_?\n\nI never can have any kind of prison-discipline disquisition in \"H. W.\"\nthat does not start with the first great principle I have laid down,\nand that does not protest against Prisons being considered _per se_.\nWhatever chance is given to a man in a prison must be given to a man in\na refuge for distress.\n\nThe article in itself is very good, but it must have these points in it,\notherwise I am not only compromising opinions I am known to hold, but\nthe journal itself is blowing hot and cold, and playing fast and loose\nin a ridiculous way.\n\n\"Starting a Paper in India\" is very droll to us. But it is full of\nreferences that the public don't understand, and don't in the least care\nfor. Bourgeois, brevier, minion, and nonpareil, long primer, turn-ups,\ndunning advertisements, and reprints, back forme, imposing-stone, and\nlocking-up, are all quite out of their way, and a sort of slang that\nthey have no interest in.\n\nLet me see a revise when you have got it together, and if you can\nstrengthen it--do. I mention all the objections that occur to me as I go\non, not because you can obviate them (except in the case of the\nprison-paper), but because if I make a point of doing so always you will\nfeel and judge the more readily both for yourself and me too when I take\nan Italian flight.\n\n                             YOU:\n                  How are the eyes getting on?\n\n                              ME:\n                  I have been at work all day.\n\n                                                    Ever faithfully.",

Next morning early we mean to try the Simplon.\n\nAfter breakfast to-day we ascended to the Mer de Glace--wonderfully\ndifferent at this time of the year from when we saw it--a great portion\nof the ascent being covered with snow, and the climbing very difficult.\nRegardless of my mule, I walked up and walked down again, to the great\nadmiration of the guides, who pronounced me \"an Intrepid.\" The little\nhouse at the top being closed for the winter, and Edward having\nforgotten to carry any brandy, we had nothing to drink at the top--which\nwas a considerable disappointment to the Inimitable, who was streaming\nwith perspiration from head to foot. But we made a fire in the snow with\nsome sticks, and after a not too comfortable rest came down again. It\ntook a long time--from 10 to 3.\n\nThe appearance of Chamounix at this time of year is very remarkable. The\ntravellers are over for the season, the inns are generally shut up, all\nthe people who can afford it are moving off to Geneva, the snow is low\non the mountains, and the general desolation and grandeur\nextraordinarily fine. I wanted to pass by the Col de Balme, but the snow\nlies too deep upon it.\n\nYou would have been quite delighted if you could have seen the warmth of\nour old Lausanne friends, and the heartiness with which they crowded\ndown on a fearfully bad morning to see us off. We passed the night at\nthe Ecu de Gen\u00e8ve, in the rooms once our old rooms--at that time (the\nday before yesterday) occupied by the Queen of the French (ex- I mean)\nand Prince Joinville and his family.\n\nTell Sydney that all the way here from Geneva, and up to the Sea of Ice\nthis morning, I wore his knitting, which was very comfortable indeed. I\nmean to wear it on the long mule journey to Martigny to-morrow.\n\nWe get on extremely well. Edward continues as before. He had never been\nhere, and I took him up to the Mer de Glace this morning, and had a mule\nfor him.\n\nI shall leave this open, as usual, to add a word or two on our arrival\nat Martigny. We have had an amusingly absurd incident this afternoon.\nWhen we came here, I saw added to the hotel--our old hotel, and I am now\nwriting in the room where we once dined at the table d'hote--some baths,\ncold and hot, down on the margin of the torrent below. This induced us\nto order three hot baths. Thereupon the keys of the bath-rooms were\nfound with immense difficulty, women ran backwards and forwards across\nthe bridge, men bore in great quantities of wood, a horrible furnace was\nlighted, and a smoke was raised which filled the whole valley. This\nbegan at half-past three, and we congratulated each other on the\ndistinction we should probably acquire by being the cause of the\nconflagration of the whole village. We sat by the fire until half-past\nfive (dinner-time), and still no baths. Then Edward came up to say that\nthe water was as yet only \"tippit,\" which we suppose to be tepid, but\nthat by half-past eight it would be in a noble state. Ever since the\nsmoke has poured forth in enormous volume, and the furnace has blazed,\nand the women have gone and come over the bridge, and piles of wood have\nbeen carried in; but we observe a general avoidance of us by the\nestablishment which still looks like failure. We have had a capital\ndinner, the dessert whereof is now on the table. When we arrived, at\nnearly seven last night, all the linen in the house, newly washed, was\npiled in the sitting-room, all the curtains were taken down, and all\nthe chairs piled bottom upwards. They cleared away as much as they could\ndirectly, and had even got the curtains up at breakfast this morning.\n\nI am looking forward to letters at Genoa, though I doubt if we shall get\nthere (supposing all things right at the Simplon) before Monday night or\nTuesday morning. I found there last night what F---- would call \"Mr.\nSmith's\" story of Mont Blanc, and took it to bed to read. It is\nextremely well and unaffectedly done. You would be interested in it.\n\n\n                           MARTIGNY, _Friday Afternoon, October 21st._\n\nSafely arrived here after a most delightful day, without a cloud. I\nwalked the whole way. The scenery most beautifully presented. We are in\nthe hotel where our old St. Bernard party assembled.\n\nI should like to see you all very much indeed.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

We crossed the Simplon on Sunday, when there was not (as there is\nnot now) a particle of cloud in the whole sky, and when the pass was as\nnobly grand and beautiful as it possibly can be. There was a good deal\nof snow upon the top, but not across the road, which had been cleared.\nWe crossed the Austrian frontier yesterday, and, both there and at the\ngate of Milan, received all possible consideration and politeness.\n\nI have not seen Bairr yet. He has removed from the old hotel to a larger\none at a few hours' distance. The head-waiter remembered me very well\nlast night after I had talked to him a little while, and was greatly\ninterested in hearing about all the family, and about poor Roche. The\nboy we used to have at Lausanne is now seventeen-and-a-half--very tall,\nhe says. The elder girl, fifteen, very like her mother, but taller and\nmore beautiful. He described poor Mrs. Bairr's death (I am speaking of\nthe head-waiter before mentioned) in most vivacious Italian. It was all\nover in ten minutes, he said. She put her hands to her head one day,\ndown in the courtyard, and cried out that she heard little bells ringing\nviolently in her ears. They sent off for Bairr, who was close by. When\nshe saw him, she stretched out her arms, said in English, \"Adieu, my\ndear!\" and fell dead. He has not married again, and he never will. She\nwas a good woman (my friend went on), excellent woman, full of charity,\nloved the poor, but _un poco furiosa_--that was nothing!\n\nThe new hotel is just like the old one, admirably kept, excellently\nfurnished, and a model of comfort. I hope to be at Genoa on Thursday\nmorning, and to find your letter there. We have agreed to drop Sicily,\nand to return home by way of Marseilles. Our projected time for reaching\nLondon is the 10th of December.\n\nAs this house is full, I daresay we shall meet some one we know at the\ntable d'hote to-day. It is extraordinary that the only travellers we\nhave encountered, since we left Paris, have been one horribly vapid\nEnglishman and wife whom we dropped at Basle, one boring Englishman whom\nwe found (and, thank God, left) at Geneva, and two English maiden\nladies, whom we found sitting on a rock (with parasols) the day before\nyesterday, in the most magnificent part of the Gorge of Gondo, the most\nawful portion of the Simplon--there awaiting their travelling chariot,\nin which, with their money, their parasols, and a perfect shop of\nbaskets, they were carefully _locked up_ by an English servant in sky\nblue and silver buttons. We have been in the most extraordinary\nvehicles--like swings, like boats, like Noah's arks, like barges and\nenormous bedsteads. After dark last night, a landlord, where we changed\nhorses, discovered that the luggage would certainly be stolen from\n_questo porco d'uno carro_--this pig of a cart--his complimentary\ndescription of our carriage, unless cords were attached to each of the\ntrunks, which cords were to hang down so that we might hold them in our\nhands all the way, and feel any tug that might be made at our treasures.\nYou will imagine the absurdity of our jolting along some twenty miles in\nthis way, exactly as if we were in three shower-baths and were afraid to\npull the string.\n\nWe are going to the Scala to-night, having got the old box belonging to\nthe hotel, the old key of which is lying beside me on the table. There\nseem to be no singers of note here now, and it appears for the time to\nhave fallen off considerably. I shall now bring this to a close, hoping\nthat I may have more interesting jottings to send you about the old\nscenes and people, from Genoa, where we shall stay two days. You are\nnow, I take it, at Macready's. I shall be greatly interested by your\naccount of your visit there. We often talk of you all.\n\nEdward's Italian is (I fear) very weak. When we began to get really into\nthe language, he reminded me of poor Roche in Germany. But he seems to\nhave picked up a little this morning. He has been unfortunate with the\nunlucky Egg, leaving a pair of his shoes (his favourite shoes) behind in\nParis, and his flannel dressing-gown yesterday morning at Domo d'Ossola.\nIn all other respects he is just as he was.\n\nEgg and Collins have gone out to kill the lions here, and I take\nadvantage of their absence to write to you, Georgie, and Miss Coutts.\nWills will have told you, I daresay, that Cerjat accompanied us on a\nmiserably wet morning, in a heavy rain, down the lake. By-the-bye, the\nwife of one of his cousins, born in France of German parents, living in\nthe next house to Haldimand's, is one of the most charming, natural,\nopen-faced, and delightful women I ever saw. Madame de ---- is set up as\nthe great attraction of Lausanne; but this capital creature shuts her up\naltogether. We have called her (her--the real belle), ever since, the\nearly closing movement.\n\nI am impatient for letters from home; confused ideas are upon me that\nyou are going to White's, but I have no notion when.\n\nTake care of yourself, and God bless you.\n\n                                             Ever most affectionately.",

I write this before going to bed, that I may\nbe sure of not being taken by any engagement off the post time\nto-morrow.\n\nWe came in last night between seven and eight. The railroad to Turin is\nfinished and opened to within twenty miles of Genoa. Its effect upon\nthe whole town, and especially upon that part of it lying down beyond\nthe lighthouse and away by San Pietro d'Arena, is quite wonderful. I\nonly knew the place by the lighthouse, so numerous were the new\nbuildings, so wide the streets, so busy the people, and so thriving and\nbusy the many signs of commerce. To-day I have seen ----, the ----, the\n----, and the ----, the latter of whom live at Nervi, fourteen or\nfifteen miles off, towards Porto Fino. First, of the ----. They are just\nthe same, except that Mrs. ----'s face is larger and fuller, and her\nhair rather gray. As I rang at their bell she came out walking, and\nstared at me. \"What! you don't know me?\" said I; upon which she\nrecognised me very warmly, and then said in her old quiet way: \"I\nexpected to find a ruin. We heard you had been so ill; and I find you\nyounger and better-looking than ever. But it's so strange to see you\nwithout a bright waistcoat. Why haven't you got a bright waistcoat on?\"\nI apologised for my black one, and was sent upstairs, when ----\npresently appeared in a hideous and demoniacal nightdress, having turned\nout of bed to greet his distinguished countryman. After a long talk, in\nthe course of which I arranged to dine there on Sunday early, before\nstarting by the steamer for Naples, and in which they told me every\npossible and impossible particular about their minutest affairs, and\nespecially about ----'s marriage, I set off for ----, at ----. I had\nfound letters from him here, and he had been here over and over again,\nand had driven out no end of times to the Gate to leave messages for me,\nand really is (in his strange uncouth way) crying glad to see me. I\nfound him and his wife in a little comfortable country house,\noverlooking the sea, sitting in a small summer-house on wheels, exactly\nlike a bathing machine. I found her rather pretty, extraordinarily cold\nand composed, a mere piece of furniture, _talking broken English_.\nThrough eight months in the year they live in this country place. She\nnever reads, never works, never talks, never gives an order or directs\nanything, has only a taste for going to the theatre (where she never\nspeaks either) and buying clothes. They sit in the garden all day, dine\nat four, _smoke their cigars_, go in at eight, sit about till ten, and\nthen go to bed. The greater part of this I had from ---- himself in a\nparticularly unintelligible confidence in the garden, the only portion\nof which that I could clearly understand were the words \"and one thing\nand another,\" repeated one hundred thousand times. He described himself\nas being perfectly happy, and seemed very fond of his wife. \"But that,\"\nsaid ---- to me this morning, looking like the figure-head of a ship,\nwith a nutmeg-grater for a face, \"that he ought to be, and must be, and\nis bound to be--he couldn't help it.\"\n\nThen I went on to the ----'s, and found them living in a beautiful\nsituation in a ruinous Albaro-like palace. Coming upon them unawares, I\nfound ----, with a pointed beard, smoking a great German pipe, in a pair\nof slippers; the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate,\nin a singularly untidy state--one (heaven knows why!) without stockings,\nand both with their little short hair cropped in a manner never before\nbeheld, and a little bright bow stuck on the top of it. ---- said she\nhad invented this headgear as a picturesque thing, adding that perhaps\nit was--and perhaps it was not. She was greatly flushed and agitated,\nbut looked very well, and seems to be greatly liked here. We had\ndisturbed her at her painting in oils, and I rather received an\nimpression that, what with that, and what with music, the household\naffairs went a little to the wall. ---- was teaching the two little\ngirls the multiplication table in a disorderly old billiard-room with\nall manner of maps in it.\n\nHaving obtained a gracious permission from the lady of the school, I am\ngoing to show my companions the Sala of the Peschiere this morning. It\nis raining intensely hard in the regular Genoa manner, so that I can\nhardly hope for Genoa's making as fine an impression as I could desire.\nOur boat for Naples is a large French mail boat, and we hope to get\nthere on Tuesday or Wednesday. If the day after you receive this you\nwrite to the Poste Restante, Rome, it will be the safest course.\nFriday's letter write Poste Restante, Florence. You refer to a letter\nyou suppose me to have received from Forster--to whom my love. No letter\nfrom him has come to hand.\n\nI will resume my report of this place in my next. In the meantime, I\nwill not fail to drink dear Katey's health to-day. Edward has just come\nin with mention of an English boat on Tuesday morning, superior to\nFrench boat to-morrow, and faster. I shall inquire at ---- and take the\nbest. When I next write I will give you our route in detail.\n\nI am pleased to hear of Mr. Robson's success in a serious part, as I\nhope he will now be a fine actor. I hope you will enjoy yourself at\nMacready's, though I fear it must be sometimes but a melancholy visit.\n\nGood-bye, my dear, and believe me ever most affectionately.\n\n\n                                               _Sunday, 30th October._\n\nWe leave for Naples to-morrow morning by the Peninsular and Oriental\nCompany's steamer the _Valletta_. I send a sketch of our movements that\nI have at last been able to make.\n\nMrs. ---- quite came out yesterday. So did Mrs. ---- (in a different\nmanner), by violently attacking Mrs. ---- for painting ill in oils when\nshe might be playing well on the piano. It rained hard all yesterday,\nbut is finer this morning. We went over the Peschiere in the wet\nafternoon.

We\nhave a charming apartment opposite the sea, a little lower down than the\nVictoria--in the direction of the San Carlo Theatre--and the windows are\nnow wide open as on an English summer night. The first persons we found\non board at Genoa, were Emerson Tennent, Lady Tennent, their son and\ndaughter. They are all here too, in an apartment over ours, and we have\nall been constantly together in a very friendly way, ever since our\nmeeting. We dine at the table d'hote--made a league together on\nboard--and have been mutually agreeable. They have no servant with them,\nand have profited by Edward. He goes on perfectly well, is always\ncheerful and ready, has been sleeping on board (upside down, I believe),\nin a corner, with his head in the wet and his heels against the side of\nthe paddle-box--but has been perpetually gay and fresh.\n\nAs soon as we got our luggage from the custom house, we packed complete\nchanges in a bag, set off in a carriage for some warm baths, and had a\nmost refreshing cleansing after our long journey. There was an odd\nNeapolitan attendant--a steady old man--who, bringing the linen into my\nbath, proposed to \"soap me.\" Upon which I called out to the other two\nthat I intended to have everything done to me that could be done, and\ngave him directions accordingly. I was frothed all over with Naples\nsoap, rubbed all down, scrubbed with a brush, had my nails cut, and all\nmanner of extraordinary operations performed. He was as much\ndisappointed (apparently) as surprised not to find me dirty, and kept on\nejaculating under his breath, \"Oh, Heaven! how clean this Englishman\nis!\" He also remarked that the Englishman is as fair as a beautiful\nwoman. Some relations of Lord John Russell's, going to Malta, were\naboardship, and we were very pleasant. Likewise there was a Mr. Young\naboard--an agreeable fellow, not very unlike Forster in person--who\nintroduced himself as the brother of the Miss Youngs whom we knew at\nBoulogne. He was musical and had much good-fellowship in him, and we\nwere very agreeable together also. On the whole I became decidedly\npopular, and was embraced on all hands when I came over the side this\nmorning. We are going up Vesuvius, of course, and to Herculaneum and\nPompeii, and the usual places. The Tennents will be our companions in\nmost of our excursions, but we shall leave them here behind us. Naples\nlooks just the same as when we left it, except that the weather is much\nbetter and brighter.\n\nOn the day before we left Genoa, we had another dinner with ---- at his\ncountry place. He was the soul of hospitality, and really seems to love\nme. You would have been quite touched if you could have seen the honest\nwarmth of his affection. On the occasion of this second banquet, Egg\nmade a brilliant mistake that perfectly convulsed us all. I had\nintroduced all the games with great success, and we were playing at the\n\"What advice would you have given that person?\" game. The advice was\n\"Not to bully his fellow-creatures.\" Upon which, Egg triumphantly and\nwith the greatest glee, screamed, \"Mr. ----!\" utterly forgetting ----'s\nrelationship, which I had elaborately impressed upon him. The effect was\nperfectly irresistible and uncontrollable; and the little woman's way of\nhumouring the joke was in the best taste and the best sense. While I am\nupon Genoa I may add, that when we left the Croce the landlord, in\nhoping that I was satisfied, told me that as I was an old inhabitant, he\nhad charged the prices \"as to a Genoese.\" They certainly were very\nreasonable.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Sartoris have lately been staying in this house, but are\njust gone. It is kept by an English waiting-maid who married an Italian\ncourier, and is extremely comfortable and clean. I am getting impatient\nto hear from you with all home news, and shall be heartily glad to get\nto Rome, and find my best welcome and interest at the post-office there.\n\nThat ridiculous ---- and her mother were at the hotel at Leghorn the day\nbefore yesterday, where the mother (poor old lady!) was so ill from the\nfright and anxiety consequent on her daughter's efforts at martyrdom,\nthat it is even doubtful whether she will recover. I learnt from a lady\nfriend of ----, that all this nonsense originated at Nice, where she was\nstirred up by Free Kirk parsons--itinerant--any one of whom I take her\nto be ready to make a semi-celestial marriage with. The dear being who\ntold me all about her was a noble specimen--single, forty, in a clinging\nflounced black silk dress, which wouldn't drape, or bustle, or fall, or\ndo anything of that sort--and with a leghorn hat on her head, at least\n(I am serious) _six feet round_. The consequence of its immense size,\nwas, that whereas it had an insinuating blue decoration in the form of a\nbow in front, it was so out of her knowledge behind, that it was all\nbattered and bent in that direction--and, viewed from that quarter, she\nlooked drunk.\n\nMy best love to Mamey and Katey, and Sydney the king of the nursery, and\nHarry and the dear little Plornishghenter. I kiss almost all the\nchildren I encounter in remembrance of their sweet faces, and talk to\nall the mothers who carry them. I hope to hear nothing but good news\nfrom you, and to find nothing but good spirits in your expected letter\nwhen I come to Rome. I already begin to look homeward, being now at the\nremotest part of the journey, and to anticipate the pleasure of return.\n\n                                             Ever most affectionately.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[55] Charles Dickens, Mr. Wilkie Collins, Mr. Augustus Egg, and Edward\nthe courier.\n\n\n\n\n1854.",

My doubts arise partly from\nthe nature of the interest which I fear requires presentation as a\nwhole, and partly on your manner of relating the tale. The people do not\nsufficiently work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic\naction. You are too much their exponent; what you do for them, they\nought to do for themselves. With reference to publication in detached\nportions (or, indeed, with a reference to the force of the story in any\nform), that long stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the\nantecedents of the clergyman's biography, are rather crippling. I may\nmention that I think the boy (the child of the second marriage) a little\ntoo \"slangy.\" I know the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a\ncharacter in these times; but, considering his part in the story, I\nregard it as the author's function to elevate such a characteristic, and\nsoften it into something more expressive of the ardour and flush of\nyouth, and its romance. It seems to me, too, that the dialogues between\nthe lady and the Italian maid are conventional but not natural. This\nobservation I regard as particularly applying to the maid, and to the\nscene preceding the murder. Supposing the main objection surmountable, I\nwould venture then to suggest to you the means of improvement in this\nrespect.\n\nThe paper is so full of good touches of character, passion, and natural\nemotion, that I very much wish for a little time to reconsider it, and\nto try whether condensation here and there would enable us to get it say\ninto four parts. I am not sanguine of this, for I observed the\ndifficulties as I read it the night before last; but I am very\nunwilling, I assure you, to decline what has so much merit.\n\nI am going to Paris on Sunday morning for ten days or so. I purpose\nbeing back again within a fortnight. If you will let me think of this\nmatter in the meanwhile, I shall at least have done all I can to satisfy\nmy own appreciation of your work.\n\nBut if, in the meantime, you should desire to have it back with any\nprospect of publishing it through other means, a letter--the shortest in\nthe world--from you to Mr. Wills at the \"Household Words\" office will\nimmediately produce it. I repeat with perfect sincerity that I am much\nimpressed by its merits, and that if I had read it as the production of\nan entire stranger, I think it would have made exactly this effect upon\nme.\n\n                                      My dear Miss King,\n                                                Very faithfully yours.",

I could no more resist this on Sunday or\nyesterday than a man can dispense with food, or a horse can help himself\nfrom being driven. I hold my inventive capacity on the stern condition\nthat it must master my whole life, often have complete possession of me,\nmake its own demands upon me, and sometimes, for months together, put\neverything else away from me. If I had not known long ago that my place\ncould never be held, unless I were at any moment ready to devote myself\nto it entirely, I should have dropped out of it very soon. All this I\ncan hardly expect you to understand--or the restlessness and waywardness\nof an author's mind. You have never seen it before you, or lived with\nit, or had occasion to think or care about it, and you cannot have the\nnecessary consideration for it. \"It is only half-an-hour,\"--\"It is only\nan afternoon,\"--\"It is only an evening,\" people say to me over and over\nagain; but they don't know that it is impossible to command one's self\nsometimes to any stipulated and set disposal of five minutes,--or that\nthe mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole\nday. These are the penalties paid for writing books. Whoever is devoted\nto an art must be content to deliver himself wholly up to it, and to\nfind his recompense in it. I am grieved if you suspect me of not wanting\nto see you, but I can't help it; I must go my way whether or no.\n\nI thought you would understand that in sending the card for the box I\nsent an assurance that there was nothing amiss. I am pleased to find\nthat you were all so interested with the play. My ladies say that the\nfirst part is too painful and wants relief. I have been going to see it\na dozen times, but have never seen it yet, and never may. Madame C\u00e9leste\nis injured thereby (you see how unreasonable people are!) and says in\nthe green-room, \"M.

WINTER,\n\nI am truly grieved to hear of your affliction in the loss of your\ndarling baby. But if you be not, even already, so reconciled to the\nparting from that innocent child for a little while, as to bear it\ngently and with a softened sorrow, I know that that not unhappy state of\nmind must soon arise. The death of infants is a release from so much\nchance and change--from so many casualties and distresses--and is a\nthing so beautiful in its serenity and peace--that it should not be a\nbitterness, even in a mother's heart. The simplest and most affecting\npassage in all the noble history of our Great Master, is His\nconsideration for little children, and in reference to yours, as many\nmillions of bereaved mothers poor and rich will do in reference to\ntheirs until the end of time, you may take the comfort of the generous\nwords, \"And He took a child, and set it in the midst of them.\"\n\nIn a book, by one of the greatest English writers, called \"A Journey\nfrom this World to the Next,\" a parent comes to the distant country\nbeyond the grave, and finds the little girl he had lost so long ago,\nengaged in building a bower to receive him in, when his aged steps\nshould bring him there at last. He is filled with joy to see her, so\nyoung--so bright--so full of promise--and is enraptured to think that\nshe never was old, wan, tearful, withered. This is always one of the\nsources of consolation in the deaths of children. With no effort of the\nfancy, with nothing to undo, you will always be able to think of the\npretty creature you have lost, _as a child_ in heaven.\n\nA poor little baby of mine lies in Highgate cemetery--and I laid her\njust as you think of laying yours, in the catacombs there, until I made\na resting-place for all of us in the free air.\n\nIt is better that I should not come to see you. I feel quite sure of\nthat, and will think of you instead.\n\nGod bless and comfort you! Mrs. Dickens and her sister send their\nkindest condolences to yourself and Mr. Winter. I add mine with all my\nheart.\n\n                                           Affectionately your friend.",

But it strongly occurred to me that Webster was going to\ndecline the play, and that he really has worried himself into a fear of\nplaying Aaron.\n\nNow, when I got this into my head--which was during the rehearsal--I\nconsidered two things:--firstly, how we could best put about the success\nof the piece more widely and extensively even than it has yet reached;\nand secondly, how you could be best assisted against a bad production\nof it hereafter, or no production of it. I thought I saw immediately,\nthat the point would be to have this representation noticed in the\nnewspapers. So I waited until the rehearsal was over and we had\nprofoundly astonished the family, and then asked Colonel Waugh what he\nthought of sending some cards for Tuesday to the papers. He highly\napproved, and I yesterday morning directed Mitchell to send to all the\nmorning papers, and to some of the weekly ones--a dozen in the whole.\n\nI dined at Lord John's yesterday (where Meyerbeer was, and said to me\nafter dinner: \"Ah, mon ami illustre! que c'est noble de vous entendre\nparler d'haute voix morale, \u00e0 la table d'un ministre!\" for I gave them a\nlittle bit of truth about Sunday that was like bringing a Sebastopol\nbattery among the polite company), I say, after this long parenthesis, I\ndined at Lord John's, and found great interest and talk about the play,\nand about what everybody who had been here had said of it. And I was\nconfirmed in my decision that the thing for you was the invitation to\nthe papers. Hence I write to tell you what I have done.\n\nI dine at home at half-past five if you are disengaged, and I shall be\nat home all the evening.\n\n                                                      Ever faithfully.\n\n        NOTE (by Mr. Wilkie Collins).--This\n        characteristically kind endeavour to induce\n        managers of theatres to produce \"The\n        Lighthouse,\" after the amateur performances of\n        the play, was not attended with any immediate\n        success.

The close of the story is unnecessarily\npainful--will throw off numbers of persons who would otherwise read it,\nand who (as it stands) will be deterred by hearsay from so doing, and is\nso tremendous a piece of severity, that it will defeat your purpose. All\nmy knowledge and experience, such as they are, lead me straight to the\nrecommendation that you will do well to spare the life of the husband,\nand of one of the children. Let her suppose the former dead, from seeing\nhim brought in wounded and insensible--lose nothing of the progress of\nher mental suffering afterwards when that doctor is in attendance upon\nher--but bring her round at last to the blessed surprise that her\nhusband is still living, and that a repentance which can be worked out,\n_in the way of atonement for the misery she has occasioned to the man\nwhom she so ill repaid for his love, and made so miserable_, lies before\nher. So will you soften the reader whom you now as it were harden, and\nso you will bring tears from many eyes, which can only have their spring\nin affectionately and gently touched hearts. I am perfectly certain that\nwith this change, all the previous part of your tale will tell for\ntwenty times as much as it can in its present condition. And it is\nbecause I believe you have a great fame before you if you do justice to\nthe remarkable ability you possess, that I venture to offer you this\nadvice in what I suppose to be the beginning of your career.\n\nI observe some parts of the story which would be strengthened, even in\ntheir psychological interest, by condensation here and there. If you\nwill leave that to me, I will perform the task as conscientiously and\ncarefully as if it were my own. But the suggestion I offer for your\nacceptance, no one but yourself can act upon.\n\nLet me conclude this hasty note with the plain assurance that I have\nnever been so much surprised and struck by any manuscript I have read,\nas I have been by yours.\n\n                                                Your faithful Servant.",

I have a general recollection of the mingling of the two, as to\nfacts and forms that should have been kept apart, in some inextricable\nmanner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement. The second was\nabout a wife's writing a Novel and keeping the secret from her husband\nuntil it was done. I did not think the incident of sufficient force to\njustify the length of the narrative. But there is nothing fatal in\neither of these mischances.\n\nMr. Wills told me when I spoke to him of the latter paper that you had\nit in contemplation to offer a longer story to \"Household Words.\" If you\nshould do so, I assure you I shall be happy to read it myself, and that\nI shall have a sincere desire to accept it, if possible.\n\nI can give you no better counsel than to look into the life about you,\nand to strive for what is noblest and true.

I cannot\ntell you with what reluctance I write to you respecting it, for my\nopinion of it is _not_ favourable, although I perceive your heart in it,\nand great strength.\n\nPray understand that I claim no infallibility. I merely express my own\nhonest opinion, formed against my earnest desire. I do not lay it down\nas law for others, though, of course, I believe that many others would\ncome to the same conclusion. It appears to me that the story is one that\ncannot possibly be told within the compass to which you have limited\nyourself. The three principal people are, every one of them, in the\nwrong with the reader, and you cannot put any of them right, without\nmaking the story extend over a longer space of time, and without\nanatomising the souls of the actors more slowly and carefully. Nothing\nwould justify the departure of Alice, but her having some strong reason\nto believe that in taking that step, _she saved her lover_. In your\nintentions as to that lover's transfer of his affections to Eleanor, I\ndescry a striking truth; but I think it confusedly wrought out, and all\nbut certain to fail in expressing itself. Eleanor, I regard as forced\nand overstrained. The natural result is, that she carries a train of\nanti-climax after her. I particularly notice this at the point when she\nthinks she is going to be drowned.\n\nThe whole idea of the story is sufficiently difficult to require the\nmost exact truth and the greatest knowledge and skill in the colouring\nthroughout. In this respect I have no doubt of its being extremely\ndefective. The people do not talk as such people would; and the little\nsubtle touches of description which, by making the country house and the\ngeneral scene real, would give an air of reality to the people (much to\nbe desired) are altogether wanting. The more you set yourself to the\nillustration of your heroine's passionate nature, the more indispensable\nthis attendant atmosphere of truth becomes. It would, in a manner,\noblige the reader to believe in her. Whereas, for ever exploding like a\ngreat firework without any background, she glares and wheels and hisses,\nand goes out, and has lighted nothing.\n\nLastly, I fear she is too convulsive from beginning to end. Pray\nreconsider, from this point of view, her brow, and her eyes, and her\ndrawing herself up to her full height, and her being a perfumed\npresence, and her floating into rooms, also her asking people how they\ndare, and the like, on small provocation. When she hears her music being\nplayed, I think she is particularly objectionable.\n\nI have a strong belief that if you keep this story by you three or four\nyears, you will form an opinion of it not greatly differing from mine.\nThere is so much good in it, so much reflection, so much passion and\nearnestness, that, if my judgment be right, I feel sure you will come\nover to it. On the other hand, I do not think that its publication, as\nit stands, would do you service, or be agreeable to you hereafter.\n\nI have no means of knowing whether you are patient in the pursuit of\nthis art; but I am inclined to think that you are not, and that you do\nnot discipline yourself enough. When one is impelled to write this or\nthat, one has still to consider: \"How much of this will tell for what I\nmean? How much of it is my own wild emotion and superfluous energy--how\nmuch remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and these\nideal circumstances?\" It is in the laborious struggle to make this\ndistinction, and in the determination to try for it, that the road to\nthe correction of faults lies. [Perhaps I may remark, in support of the\nsincerity with which I write this, that I am an impatient and impulsive\nperson myself, but that it has been for many years the constant effort\nof my life to practise at my desk what I preach to you.]\n\nI should not have written so much, or so plainly, but for your last\nletter to me. It seems to demand that I should be strictly true with\nyou, and I am so in this letter, without any reservation either way.\n\n                                                Very faithfully yours.\n\n\n\n\n1858.",

Chorley.]\n\n          [69]TAVISTOCK HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, W.C.,\n                                         _Friday Night, Feb. 3, 1860._\n\nMY DEAR CHORLEY,\n\nI can most honestly assure you that I think \"Roccabella\" a very\nremarkable book indeed. Apart--quite apart--from my interest in you, I\nam certain that if I had taken it up under any ordinarily favourable\ncircumstances as a book of which I knew nothing whatever, I should\nnot--could not--have relinquished it until I had read it through. I had\nturned but a few pages, and come to the shadow on the bright sofa at the\nfoot of the bed, when I knew myself to be in the hands of an artist.\nThat rare and delightful recognition I never lost for a moment until I\nclosed the second volume at the end. I am \"a good audience\" when I have\nreason to be, and my girls would testify to you, if there were need,\nthat I cried over it heartily. Your story seems to me remarkably\ningenious. I had not the least idea of the purport of the sealed paper\nuntil you chose to enlighten me; and then I felt it to be quite natural,\nquite easy, thoroughly in keeping with the character and presentation of\nthe Liverpool man. The position of the Bell family in the story has a\nspecial air of nature and truth; is quite new to me, and is so\ndexterously and delicately done that I find the deaf daughter no less\nreal and distinct than the clergyman's wife. The turn of the story round\nthat damnable Princess I pursued with a pleasure with which I could\npursue nothing but a true interest; and I declare to you that if I were\nput upon finding anything better than the scene of Roccabella's death, I\nshould stare round my bookshelves very much at a loss for a long time.\nSimilarly, your characters have really surprised me. From the lawyer to\nthe Princess, I swear to them as true; and in your fathoming of Rosamond\naltogether, there is a profound wise knowledge that I admire and respect\nwith a heartiness not easily overstated in words.\n\nI am not quite with you as to the Italians. Your knowledge of the\nItalian character seems to me surprisingly subtle and penetrating;\nbut I think we owe it to those most unhappy men and their political\nwretchedness to ask ourselves mercifully, whether their faults\nare not essentially the faults of a people long oppressed and\npriest-ridden;--whether their tendency to slink and conspire is not a\ntendency that spies in every dress, from the triple crown to a lousy\nhead, have engendered in their ancestors through generations? Again,\nlike you, I shudder at the distresses that come of these unavailing\nrisings; my blood runs hotter, as yours does, at the thought of the\nleaders safe, and the instruments perishing by hundreds; yet what is to\nbe done? Their wrongs are so great that they _will_ rise from time to\ntime somehow. It would be to doubt the eternal providence of God to\ndoubt that they will rise successfully at last. Unavailing struggles\nagainst a dominant tyranny precede all successful turning against it.\nAnd is it not a little hard in us Englishman, whose forefathers have\nrisen so often and striven against so much, to look on, in our own\nsecurity, through microscopes, and detect the motes in the brains of men\ndriven mad? Think, if you and I were Italians, and had grown from\nboyhood to our present time, menaced in every day through all these\nyears by that infernal confessional, dungeons, and soldiers, could we be\nbetter than these men? Should we be so good? I should not, I am afraid,\nif I know myself. Such things would make of me a moody, bloodthirsty,\nimplacable man, who would do anything for revenge; and if I compromised\nthe truth--put it at the worst, habitually--where should I ever have had\nit before me? In the old Jesuits' college at Genoa, on the Chiaja at\nNaples, in the churches of Rome, at the University of Padua, on the\nPiazzo San Marco at Venice, where? And the government is in all these\nplaces, and in all Italian places. I have seen something of these men. I\nhave known Mazzini and Gallenga; Manin was tutor to my daughters in\nParis; I have had long talks about scores of them with poor Ary\nScheffer, who was their best friend. I have gone back to Italy after ten\nyears, and found the best men I had known there exiled or in jail. I\nbelieve they have the faults you ascribe to them (nationally, not\nindividually), but I could not find it in my heart, remembering their\nmiseries, to exhibit those faults without referring them back to their\ncauses. You will forgive my writing this, because I write it exactly as\nI write my cordial little tribute to the high merits of your book. If\nit were not a living reality to me, I should care nothing about this\npoint of disagreement; but you are far too earnest a man, and far too\nable a man, to be left unremonstrated with by an admiring reader. You\ncannot write so well without influencing many people. If you could tell\nme that your book had but twenty readers, I would reply, that so good a\nbook will influence more people's opinions, through those twenty, than a\nworthless book would through twenty thousand; and I express this with\nthe perfect confidence of one in whose mind the book has taken, for good\nand all, a separate and distinct place.\n\nAccept my thanks for the pleasure you have given me. The poor\nacknowledgment of testifying to that pleasure wherever I go will be my\npleasure in return. And so, my dear Chorley, good night, and God bless\nyou.\n\n                                                Ever faithfully yours.",

And before I say anything further I may tell you that I\nCOULD NOT lay them aside, but was obliged to go on with them in my\nbedroom until I got into a very ghostly state indeed. This morning I\nhave taken them again and have gone through them with the utmost\nattention.\n\nOf the beauty and power of the writing I say not a word, or of its\noriginality and boldness, or of its quite extraordinary constructive\nskill. I confine myself solely to your misgiving, and to the question\nwhether there is any sufficient foundation for it.\n\nOn the last head I say, without the faintest hesitation, most decidedly\nthere is NOT sufficient foundation for it. I do not share it in the\nleast. I believe that the readers who have here given their minds (or\nperhaps had any to give) to those strange psychological mysteries in\nourselves, of which we are all more or less conscious, will accept your\nwonders as curious weapons in the armoury of fiction, and will submit\nthemselves to the Art with which said weapons are used. Even to that\nclass of intelligence the marvellous addresses itself from a very strong\nposition; and that class of intelligence is not accustomed to find the\nmarvellous in such very powerful hands as yours. On more imaginative\nreaders the tale will fall (or I am greatly mistaken) like a spell. By\nreaders who combine some imagination, some scepticism, and some\nknowledge and learning, I hope it will be regarded as full of strange\nfancy and curious study, startling reflections of their own thoughts and\nspeculations at odd times, and wonder which a master has a right to\nevoke. In the last point lies, to my thinking, the whole case. If you\nwere the Magician's servant instead of the Magician, these potent\nspirits would get the better of you; but you _are_ the Magician, and\nthey don't, and you make them serve your purpose.\n\nOccasionally in the dialogue I see an expression here and there which\nmight--always solely with a reference to your misgiving--be better away;\nand I think that the vision, to use the word for want of a better--in\nthe museum, should be made a little less abstruse. I should not say\nthat, if the sale of the journal was below the sale of _The Times_\nnewspaper; but as it is probably several thousands higher, I do. I would\nalso suggest that after the title we put the two words--A ROMANCE. It is\nan absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving with the\nblockheads, but I think it would be an effective one. I don't, on\nlooking at it, like the title. Here are a few that have occurred to me.\n\n\"The Steel Casket.\"\n\n\"The Lost Manuscript.\"\n\n\"Derval Court.\"\n\n\"Perpetual Youth.\"\n\n\"Maggie.\"\n\n\"Dr. Fenwick.\"\n\n\"Life and Death.\"\n\nThe four last I think the best. There is an objection to \"Dr. Fenwick\"\nbecause there has been \"Dr. Antonio,\" and there is a book of Dumas'\nwhich repeats the objection. I don't think \"Fenwick\" startling enough.\nIt appears to me that a more startling title would take the (John) Bull\nby the horns, and would be a serviceable concession to your misgiving,\nas suggesting a story off the stones of the gas-lighted Brentford Road.\n\nThe title is the first thing to be settled, and cannot be settled too\nsoon.\n\nFor the purposes of the weekly publication the divisions of the story\nwill often have to be greatly changed, though afterwards, in the\ncomplete book, you can, of course, divide it into chapters, free from\nthat reference. For example: I would end the first chapter on the third\nslip at \"and through the ghostly streets, under the ghostly moon, went\nback to my solitary room.\" The rest of what is now your first chapter\nmight be made Chapter II., and would end the first weekly part.\n\nI think I have become, by dint of necessity and practice, rather cunning\nin this regard; and perhaps you would not mind my looking closely to\nsuch points from week to week. It so happens that if you had written the\nopening of this story expressly for the occasion its striking incidents\ncould not possibly have followed one another better. One other merely\nmechanical change I suggest now. I would not have an initial letter for\nthe town, but would state in the beginning that I gave the town a\nfictitious name. I suppose a blank or a dash rather fends a good many\npeople off--because it always has that effect upon me.\n\nBe sure that I am perfectly frank and open in all I have said in this\nnote, and that I have not a grain of reservation in my mind. I think the\nstory a very fine one, one that no other man could write, and that there\nis no strength in your misgiving for the two reasons: firstly, that the\nwork is professedly a work of Fancy and Fiction, in which the reader is\nnot required against his will to take everything for Fact; secondly,\nthat it is written by the man who can write it. The Magician's servant\ndoes not know what to do with the ghost, and has, consequently, no\nbusiness with him. The Magician does know what to do with him, and has\nall the business with him that he can transact.\n\nI am quite at ease on the points that you have expressed yourself as not\nat ease upon. Quite. I cannot too often say that if they were carried on\nweak shoulders they would break the bearer down. But in your mastering\nof them lies the mastery over the reader.\n\nThis will reach you at Knebworth, I hope, to-morrow afternoon. Pray give\nyour doubts to the winds of that high spot, and believe that if I had\nthem I would swarm up the flag-staff quite as nimbly as Margrave and\nnail the Fenwick colours to the top.\n\n                                            Ever affectionately yours.",

I think you undoubtedly _have_ the right to forbid the turning of\nyour play into an opera.\n\n2. I do _not_ think the production of such an opera in the slightest\ndegree likely to injure the play or to render it a less valuable\nproperty than it is now. If it could have any effect on so standard and\npopular a work as \"The Lady of Lyons,\" the effect would, in my judgment,\nbe beneficial. But I believe the play to be high above any such\ninfluence.\n\n3. Assuming you do consent to the adaptation, in a desire to oblige\nOxenford, I would not recommend your asking any pecuniary compensation.\nThis for two reasons: firstly, because the compensation could only be\nsmall at the best; secondly, because your taking it would associate you\n(unreasonably, but not the less assuredly) with the opera.\n\nThe only objection I descry is purely one of feeling. Pauline trotting\nabout in front of the float, invoking the orchestra with a limp\npocket-handkerchief, is a notion that makes goose-flesh of my back. Also\na yelping tenor going away to the wars in a scene a half-an-hour long is\npainful to contemplate.

Both the matter of\nthe materials and the manner of their arrangement were quite admirable,\nand a modesty and complete absence of any kind of affectation pervaded\nthe whole discourse, which was quite an example to the many whom it\nconcerns. If you could be a very little louder, and would never let a\nsentence go for the thousandth part of an instant until the last word\nis out, you would find the audience more responsive.\n\nA spoken sentence will never run alone in all its life, and is never to\nbe trusted to itself in its most insignificant member. See it _well\nout_--with the voice--and the part of the audience is made surprisingly\neasier. In that excellent description of the Spanish mendicant and his\nguitar, as well as the very happy touches about the dance and the\ncastanets, the people were really desirous to express very hearty\nappreciation; but by giving them rather too much to do in watching and\nlistening for latter words, you stopped them. I take the liberty of\nmaking the remark, as one who has fought with beasts (oratorically) in\ndivers arenas. For the rest nothing could be better. Knowledge,\ningenuity, neatness, condensation, good sense, and good taste in\ndelightful combination.\n\n                                                Affectionately always.",

Through\ndetermined occupation and action, lies the way. Be sure of it.\n\nI came over to France before Georgina and Mary, and went to Boulogne to\nmeet them coming in by the steamer on the great Sunday--the day of the\nstorm. I stood (holding on with both hands) on the pier at Boulogne,\nfive hours. The Sub-Marine Telegraph had telegraphed their boat as\nhaving come out of Folkestone--though the companion boat from Boulogne\ndidn't try it--and at nine o'clock at night, she being due at six, there\nwere no signs of her. My principal dread was, that she would try to get\ninto Boulogne; which she could not possibly have done without carrying\naway everything on deck. The tide at nine o'clock being too low for any\nsuch desperate attempt, I thought it likely that they had run for the\nDowns and would knock about there all night. So I went to the Inn to dry\nmy pea-jacket and get some dinner anxiously enough, when, at about ten,\ncame a telegram from them at Calais to say they had run in there. To\nCalais I went, post, next morning, expecting to find them half-dead (of\ncourse, they had arrived half-drowned), but I found them elaborately got\nup to come on to Paris by the next Train, and the most wonderful thing\nof all was, that they hardly seem to have been frightened! Of course,\nthey had discovered at the end of the voyage, that a young bride and her\nhusband, the only other passengers on deck, and with whom they had been\ntalking all the time, were an officer from Chatham whom they knew very\nwell (when dry), just married and going to India! So they all set up\nhouse-keeping together at Dessin's at Calais (where I am well known),\nand looked as if they had been passing a mild summer there.\n\nWe have a pretty apartment here, but house-rent is awful to mention.\nMrs. Bouncer (muzzled by the Parisian police) is also here, and is a\nwonderful spectacle to behold in the streets, restrained like a raging\nLion.\n\nI learn from an embassy here, that the Emperor has just made an earnest\nproposal to our Government to unite with France (and Russia, if Russia\nwill) in an appeal to America to stop the brutal war. Our Government's\nanswer is not yet received, but I think I clearly perceive that the\nproposal will be declined, on the ground \"that the time has not yet\ncome.\"\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[73] The first of the series on \"National Music.\"\n\n\n\n\n1863.",

Secondly, because my married daughter and her\nhusband are with us. Thirdly, because my two boys are at home for their\nholidays.\n\nBut if you would come out of that murky electioneering atmosphere and\ncome to us, you don't know how delighted we should be. You should have\nyour own way as completely as though you were at home. You should have a\ncheery room, and you should have a Swiss ch\u00e2let all to yourself to write\nin. _Smoking regarded as a personal favour to the family._ Georgina is\nso insupportably vain on account of being a favourite of yours, that you\nmight find _her_ a drawback; but nothing else would turn out in that\nway, I hope.\n\n_Won't_ you manage it? _Do_ think of it. If, for instance, you would\ncome back with us on that Guild Saturday. I have turned the house upside\ndown and inside out since you were here, and have carved new rooms out\nof places then non-existent. Pray do think of it, and do manage it. I\nshould be heartily pleased.\n\nI hope you will find the purpose and the plot of my book very plain when\nyou see it as a whole piece. I am looking forward to sending you the\nproofs complete about the end of next month. It is all sketched out and\nI am working hard on it, giving it all the pains possible to be bestowed\non a labour of love. Your critical opinion two months in advance of the\npublic will be invaluable to me. For you know what store I set by it,\nand how I think over a hint from you.\n\nI notice the latest piece of poisoning ingenuity in Pritchard's case.\nWhen he had made his medical student boarders sick, by poisoning the\nfamily food, he then quietly walked out, took an emetic, and made\nhimself sick. This with a view to ask them, in examination on a\npossible trial, whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the\nrest?--A question naturally asked for him and answered in the\naffirmative. From which I get at the fact.\n\nIf your constituency don't bring you in they deserve to lose you, and\nmay the Gods continue to confound them! I shudder at the thought of such\npublic life as political life. Would there not seem to be something\nhorribly rotten in the system of it, when one stands amazed how any\nman--not forced into it by position, as you are--can bear to live it?\n\nBut the private life here is my point, and again I urge upon you. Do\nthink of it, and Do come.\n\nI want to tell you how I have been impressed by the \"Boatman.\" It haunts\nme as only a beautiful and profound thing can. The lines are always\nrunning in my head, as the river runs with me.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

These changes from muggy weather to slight sharp frost, and\nback again, touch weak places, as I find by my own foot; but the touch\ngoes by. May it prove so with you!\n\nYesterday Captain ----, Captain ----, and Captain ----, dined at Gad's.\nThey are, all three, naval officers of the highest reputation. ---- is\nsupposed to be the best sailor in our Service. I said I had been\nremarking at home, _\u00e0 propos_ of the _London_, that I knew of no\nshipwreck of a large strong ship (not carrying weight of guns) in the\nopen sea, and that I could find none such in the shipwreck books. They\nall agreed that the unfortunate Captain Martin _must_ have been\nunacquainted with the truth as to what can and what can not be done with\na Steamship having rigging and canvas; and that no sailor would dream of\nturning a ship's stern to such a gale--_unless his vessel could run\nfaster than the sea_. ---- said (and the other two confirmed) that the\n_London_ was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a\ngale, and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm\ntopsail--which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent\naloft, and can be set under the worst circumstances--the disaster could\nnot have occurred. If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it,\neven of hammocks and the like. They said that under a Board of Enquiry\ninto the wreck, any efficient witness must of necessity state this as\nthe fact, and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the\nseamanship was utterly bad; and as to the force of the wind, for which I\nsuggested allowance, they all had been in West Indian hurricanes and in\nTyphoons, and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the\nmost adverse circumstances.\n\nI thought you might be interested in this, as you have no doubt been\ninterested in the case. They had a great respect for the unfortunate\nCaptain's character, and for his behaviour when the case was hopeless,\nbut they had not the faintest doubt that he lost the ship and those two\nhundred and odd lives.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

I made an appointment in London,\nand observed that when he _did_ see me he was obviously astonished.\nWhile I was sensible that the magnificence of my appearance would fully\naccount for his being overcome, I nevertheless angled for the cause of\nhis surprise. He then told me that there was a paragraph going round the\npapers to the effect that I was \"in a critical state of health.\" I asked\nhim if he was sure it wasn't \"cricketing\" state of health. To which he\nreplied, Quite. I then asked him down here to dinner, and he was again\nstaggered by finding me in sporting training; also much amused.\n\nYesterday's and to-day's post bring me this unaccountable paragraph from\nhosts of uneasy friends, with the enormous and wonderful addition that\n\"eminent surgeons\" are sending me to America for \"cessation from\nliterary labour\"!!! So I have written a quiet line to _The Times_,\ncertifying to my own state of health, and have also begged Dixon to do\nthe like in _The Athen\u00e6um_.

Pauline is weak, but so carefully trained and\nfitted into the picture as to be never disagreeable, and sometimes (as\nin the last scene) very pathetic. Fechter has played nothing nearly so\nwell as Claude since he played in Paris in the \"Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\" or\nin London as Ruy Blas. He played the fourth act as finely as Macready,\nand the first much better. The dress and bearing in the fifth act are\nquite new, and quite excellent.\n\nOf the Scenic arrangements, the most noticeable are:--the picturesque\nstruggle of the cottage between the taste of an artist, and the domestic\nmeans of poverty (expressed to the eye with infinite tact);--the view of\nLyons (Act v. Scene 1), with a foreground of quay wall which the\nofficers are leaning on, waiting for the general;--and the last scene--a\nsuite of rooms giving on a conservatory at the back, through which the\nmoon is shining. You are to understand that all these scenic appliances\nare subdued to the Piece, instead of the Piece being sacrificed to them;\nand that every group and situation has to be considered, not only with a\nreference to each by itself, but to the whole story.\n\nBeaus\u00e9ant's speaking the original contents of the letter was a decided\npoint, and the immense house was quite breathless when the Tempter and\nthe Tempted stood confronted as he made the proposal.\n\nThere was obviously a great interest in seeing a Frenchman play the\npart. The scene between Claude and Gaspar (the small part very well\ndone) was very closely watched for the same reason, and was loudly\napplauded. I cannot say too much of the brightness, intelligence,\npicturesqueness, and care of Fechter's impersonation throughout. There\nwas a remarkable delicacy in his gradually drooping down on his way home\nwith his bride, until he fell upon the table, a crushed heap of shame\nand remorse, while his mother told Pauline the story. His gradual\nrecovery of himself as he formed better resolutions was equally well\nexpressed; and his being at last upright again and rushing\nenthusiastically to join the army, brought the house down.\n\nI wish you could have been there. He never spoke English half so well as\nhe spoke your English; and the audience heard it with the finest\nsympathy and respect. I felt that I should have been very proud indeed\nto have been the writer of the Play.\n\n                                                  Ever affectionately.",

For twenty years I\nam perfectly certain that I have never made any other allusion to the\nrepublication of my books in America than the good-humoured remark,\n\"that if there had been international copyright between England and the\nStates, I should have been a man of very large fortune, instead of a\nman of moderate savings, always supporting a very expensive public\nposition.\" Nor have I ever been such a fool as to charge the absence of\ninternational copyright upon individuals. Nor have I ever been so\nungenerous as to disguise or suppress the fact that I have received\nhandsome sums for advance sheets. When I was in the States, I said what\nI had to say on the question, and there an end. I am absolutely certain\nthat I have never since expressed myself, even with soreness, on the\nsubject. Reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the London\ncorrespondent, the statement that I ever talked about \"these fellows\"\nwho republished my books or pretended to know (what I don't know at this\ninstant) who made how much out of them, or ever talked of their sending\nme \"conscience money,\" is as grossly and completely false as the\nstatement that I ever said anything to the effect that I could not be\nexpected to have an interest in the American people. And nothing can by\nany possibility be falser than that. Again and again in these pages\n(\"All the Year Round\") I have expressed my interest in them. You will\nsee it in the \"Child's History of England.\" You will see it in the last\npreface to \"American Notes.\" Every American who has ever spoken with me\nin London, Paris, or where not, knows whether I have frankly said, \"You\ncould have no better introduction to me than your country.\" And for\nyears and years when I have been asked about reading in America, my\ninvariable reply has been, \"I have so many friends there, and\nconstantly receive so many earnest letters from personally unknown\nreaders there, that, but for domestic reasons, I would go to-morrow.\" I\nthink I must, in the confidential intercourse between you and me, have\nwritten you to this effect more than once.\n\nThe statement of the London correspondent from beginning to end is\nfalse. It is false in the letter and false in the spirit. He may have\nbeen misinformed, and the statement may not have originated with him.\nWith whomsoever it originated, it never originated with me, and\nconsequently is false. More than enough about it.\n\nAs I hope to see you so soon, my dear Fields, and as I am busily at work\non the Christmas number, I will not make this a longer letter than I can\nhelp. I thank you most heartily for your proffered hospitality, and need\nnot tell you that if I went to any friend's house in America, I would go\nto yours. But the readings are very hard work, and I think I cannot do\nbetter than observe the rule on that side of the Atlantic which I\nobserve on this, of never, under such circumstances, going to a friend's\nhouse, but always staying at a hotel. I am able to observe it here, by\nbeing consistent and never breaking it. If I am equally consistent\nthere, I can (I hope) offend no one.\n\nDolby sends his love to you and all his friends (as I do), and is\ngirding up his loins vigorously.\n\n                         Ever, my dear Fields,\n                                    Heartily and affectionately yours.",

I see the kind\nof actor who _must_ play Hegio, and I see that the audience will not\nbelieve in his doing anything so serious. (I suppose it would be\nimpossible to get this effect out of the mother--or through the\nmother's influence, instead of out of the godfather of Hegiopolis?)\n\nNow, as to the classical ground and manners of the Play. I suppose the\nobjection to the Greek dress to be already--as Defoe would write it,\n\"gotten over\" by your suggestion. I suppose the dress not to be\nconventionally associated with stilts and boredom, but to be new to the\npublic eye and very picturesque. Grant all that;--the names remain. Now,\nnot only used such names to be inseparable in the public mind from\nstately weariness, but of late days they have become inseparable in the\nsame public mind from silly puns upon the names, and from Burlesque. You\ndo not know (I hope, at least, for my friend's sake) what the Strand\nTheatre is. A Greek name and a break-down nigger dance, have become\ninseparable there. I do not mean to say that your genius may not be too\npowerful for such associations; but I do most positively mean to say\nthat you would lose half the play in overcoming them. At the best you\nwould have to contend against them through the first three acts. The old\ntendency to become frozen on classical ground would be in the best part\nof the audience; the new tendency to titter on such ground would be in\nthe worst part. And instead of starting fair with the audience, it is my\nconviction that you would start with them against you and would have to\nwin them over.\n\nFurthermore, with reference to your note to me on this head, you take up\na position with reference to poor dear Talfourd's \"Ion\" which I\naltogether dispute. It never was a popular play, I say. It derived a\ncertain amount of out-of-door's popularity from the circumstances under\nwhich, and the man by whom, it was written. But I say that it never was\na popular play on the Stage, and never made out a case of attraction\nthere.\n\nAs to changing the ground to Russia, let me ask you, did you ever see\nthe \"Nouvelles Russes\" of Nicolas Gogol, translated into French by Louis\nViardot? There is a story among them called \"Tarass Boulla,\" in which,\nas it seems to me, all the conditions you want for such transplantation\nare to be found. So changed, you would have the popular sympathy with\nthe Slave or Serf, or Prisoner of War, from the first. But I do not\nthink it is to be got, save at great hazard, and with lamentable waste\nof force on the ground the Play now occupies.\n\nI shall keep this note until to-morrow to correct my conviction if I can\nsee the least reason for correcting it; but I feel very confident indeed\nthat I cannot be shaken in it.\n\n                                   \n\n\n                                                           _Saturday._\n\nI have thought it over again, and have gone over the play again with an\nimaginary stage and actors before me, and I am still of the same mind.\nShall I keep the MS. till you come to town?\n\n                                Believe me, ever affectionately yours.",

The _Russia_ is\na magnificent ship, and has dashed along bravely. We had made more than\nthirteen hundred and odd miles at noon to-day. The wind, after being a\nlittle capricious, rather threatens at the present time to turn against\nus, but our run is already eighty miles ahead of the _Russia's_ last run\nin this direction--a very fast one. . . . To all whom it may concern,\nreport the _Russia_ in the highest terms. She rolls more easily than\nthe other Cunard Screws, is kept in perfect order, and is most carefully\nlooked after in all departments. We have had nothing approaching to\nheavy weather, still one can speak to the trim of the ship. Her captain,\na gentleman; bright, polite, good-natured, and vigilant. . . .\n\nAs to me, I am greatly better, I hope. I have got on my right boot\nto-day for the first time; the \"true American\" seems to be turning\nfaithless at last; and I made a Gad's Hill breakfast this morning, as a\nfurther advance on having otherwise eaten and drunk all day ever since\nWednesday.\n\nYou will see Anthony Trollope, I daresay. What was my amazement to see\nhim with these eyes come aboard in the mail tender just before we\nstarted! He had come out in the _Scotia_ just in time to dash off again\nin said tender to shake hands with me, knowing me to be aboard here. It\nwas most heartily done. He is on a special mission of convention with\nthe United States post-office.\n\nWe have been picturing your movements, and have duly checked off your\njourney home, and have talked about you continually. But I have thought\nabout you both, even much, much more. You will never know how I love you\nboth; or what you have been to me in America, and will always be to me\neverywhere; or how fervently I thank you.\n\nAll the working of the ship seems to be done on my forehead. It is\nscrubbed and holystoned (my head--not the deck) at three every morning.\nIt is scraped and swabbed all day. Eight pairs of heavy boots are now\nclattering on it, getting the ship under sail again. Legions of\nropes'-ends are flopped upon it as I write, and I must leave off with\nDolby's love.\n\n                                   \n\n\n                                                     _Thursday, 30th._\n\nSoon after I left off as above we had a gale of wind which blew all\nnight. For a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no\ngetting from this cabin of mine to the saloon, or _vice vers\u00e2_, so\nheavily did the sea break over the decks. The ship, however, made\nnothing of it, and we were all right again by Monday afternoon. Except\nfor a few hours yesterday (when we had a very light head-wind), the\nweather has been constantly favourable, and we are now bowling away at a\ngreat rate, with a fresh breeze filling all our sails. We expect to be\nat Queenstown between midnight and three in the morning.\n\nI hope, my dear Fields, you may find this legible, but I rather doubt\nit, for there is motion enough on the ship to render writing to a\nlandsman, however accustomed to pen and ink, rather a difficult\nachievement. Besides which, I slide away gracefully from the paper,\nwhenever I want to be particularly expressive. . . .\n\n----, sitting opposite to me at breakfast, always has the following\nitems: A large dish of porridge into which he casts slices of butter and\na quantity of sugar. Two cups of tea. A steak. Irish stew. Chutnee and\nmarmalade. Another deputation of two has solicited a reading to-night.\nIllustrious novelist has unconditionally and absolutely declined.

FIELDS,\n\nAs you ask me about the dogs, I begin with them. When I came down first,\nI came to Gravesend, five miles off. The two Newfoundland dogs, coming\nto meet me with the usual carriage and the usual driver, and beholding\nme coming in my usual dress out at the usual door, it struck me that\ntheir recollection of my having been absent for any unusual time was at\nonce cancelled. They behaved (they are both young dogs) exactly in their\nusual manner; coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along, and\nlifting their heads to have their ears pulled--a special attention which\nthey receive from no one else. But when I drove into the stable-yard,\nLinda (the St. Bernard) was greatly excited; weeping profusely, and\nthrowing herself on her back that she might caress my foot with her\ngreat fore-paws. Mamie's little dog, too, Mrs. Bouncer, barked in the\ngreatest agitation on being called down and asked by Mamie, \"Who is\nthis?\" and tore round and round me, like the dog in the Faust outlines.\nYou must know that all the farmers turned out on the road in their\nmarket-chaises to say, \"Welcome home, sir!\" and that all the houses\nalong the road were dressed with flags; and that our servants, to cut\nout the rest, had dressed this house so that every brick of it was\nhidden. They had asked Mamie's permission to \"ring the alarm-bell\" (!)\nwhen master drove up, but Mamie, having some slight idea that that\ncompliment might awaken master's sense of the ludicrous, had recommended\nbell abstinence. But on Sunday the village choir (which includes the\nbell-ringers) made amends. After some unusually brief pious reflections\nin the crowns of their hats at the end of the sermon, the ringers bolted\nout, and rang like mad until I got home. There had been a conspiracy\namong the villagers to take the horse out, if I had come to our own\nstation, and draw me here. Mamie and Georgy had got wind of it and\nwarned me.\n\nDivers birds sing here all day, and the nightingales all night. The\nplace is lovely, and in perfect order. I have put five mirrors in the\nSwiss ch\u00e2let (where I write) and they reflect and refract in all kinds\nof ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows, and the great\nfields of waving corn, and the sail-dotted river. My room is up among\nthe branches of the trees; and the birds and the butterflies fly in and\nout, and the green branches shoot in, at the open windows, and the\nlights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the\ncompany. The scent of the flowers, and indeed of everything that is\ngrowing for miles and miles, is most delicious.\n\nDolby (who sends a world of messages) found his wife much better than he\nexpected, and the children (wonderful to relate!) perfect. The little\ngirl winds up her prayers every night with a special commendation to\nHeaven of me and the pony--as if I must mount him to get there! I dine\nwith Dolby (I was going to write \"him,\" but found it would look as if I\nwere going to dine with the pony) at Greenwich this very day, and if\nyour ears do not burn from six to nine this evening, then the Atlantic\nis a non-conductor. We are already settling--think of this!--the details\nof my farewell course of readings. I am brown beyond belief, and cause\nthe greatest disappointment in all quarters by looking so well. It is\nreally wonderful what those fine days at sea did for me! My doctor was\nquite broken down in spirits when he saw me, for the first time since my\nreturn, last Saturday. \"Good Lord!\" he said, recoiling, \"seven years\nyounger!\"\n\nIt is time I should explain the otherwise inexplicable enclosure. Will\nyou tell Fields, with my love (I suppose he hasn't used _all_ the pens\nyet?), that I think there is in Tremont Street a set of my books, sent\nout by Chapman, not arrived when I departed.

I particularly want the\ndrugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the Swiss inn to\nbe done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind.\nAlthough in the very opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall\nand listen to it, nobody thought of its mysterious music.

Fields.]\n\n                          GAD'S HILL PLACE, _Tuesday, 7th July, 1868._\n\nMY DEAR FIELDS,\n\nI have delayed writing to you (and Mrs. Fields, to whom my love) until I\nshould have seen Longfellow. When he was in London the first time he\ncame and went without reporting himself, and left me in a state of\nunspeakable discomfiture. Indeed, I should not have believed in his\nhaving been here at all, if Mrs. Procter had not told me of his calling\nto see Procter. However, on his return he wrote to me from the Langham\nHotel, and I went up to town to see him, and to make an appointment for\nhis coming here. He, the girls, and Appleton, came down last Saturday\nnight and stayed until Monday forenoon. I showed them all the\nneighbouring country that could be shown in so short a time, and they\nfinished off with a tour of inspection of the kitchens, pantry,\nwine-cellar, pickles, sauces, servants' sitting-room, general household\nstores, and even the Cellar Book, of this illustrious establishment.\nForster and Kent (the latter wrote certain verses to Longfellow, which\nhave been published in _The Times_, and which I sent to D----) came down\nfor a day, and I hope we all had a really \"good time.\" I turned out a\ncouple of postillions in the old red jacket of the old red royal Dover\nRoad, for our ride; and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty\nyears ago. Of course we went to look at the old houses in Rochester, and\nthe old cathedral, and the old castle, and the house for the six poor\ntravellers who, \"not being rogues or procters, shall have lodging,\nentertainment, and four pence each.\"\n\nNothing can surpass the respect paid to Longfellow here, from the Queen\ndownward. He is everywhere received and courted, and finds (as I told\nhim he would, when we talked of it in Boston) the working-men at least\nas well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above\nthem. . . .\n\nLast Thursday I attended, as sponsor, the christening of Dolby's son and\nheir--a most jolly baby, who held on tight by the rector's left whisker\nwhile the service was performed. What time, too, his little sister,\nconnecting me with the pony, trotted up and down the centre aisle,\nnoisily driving herself as that celebrated animal, so that it went very\nhard with the sponsorial dignity.\n\nWills is not yet recovered from that concussion of the brain, and I have\nall his work to do. This may account for my not being able to devise a\nChristmas number, but I seem to have left my invention in America. In\ncase you should find it, please send it over. I am going up to town\nto-day to dine with Longfellow. And now, my dear Fields, you know all\nabout me and mine.\n\nYou are enjoying your holiday? and are still thinking sometimes of our\nBoston days, as I do? and are maturing schemes for coming here next\nsummer? A satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly\nentreated.\n\nI am delighted to find you both so well pleased with the Blind Book\nscheme.[94] I said nothing of it to you when we were together, though I\nhad made up my mind, because I wanted to come upon you with that little\nburst from a distance. It seemed something like meeting again when I\nremitted the money and thought of your talking of it.\n\nThe dryness of the weather is amazing. All the ponds and surface-wells\nabout here are waterless, and the poor people suffer greatly. The people\nof this village have only one spring to resort to, and it is a couple of\nmiles from many cottages. I do not let the great dogs swim in the canal,\nbecause the people have to drink of it. But when they get into the\nMedway it is hard to get them out again. The other day Bumble (the son,\nNewfoundland dog) got into difficulties among some floating timber, and\nbecame frightened. Don (the father) was standing by me, shaking off the\nwet and looking on carelessly, when all of a sudden he perceived\nsomething amiss, and went in with a bound and brought Bumble out by the\near. The scientific way in which he towed him along was charming.\n\n                                                     Ever your loving.",

Some\nMassachusetts men do believe in such a thing, but they fail (as I\nthink) to take into account the prompt western opposition.\n\nSuch an alteration as you suggest in the English law would give no\ncopyright in America, you see. The American publisher could buy no\nabsolute _right_ of priority. Any American newspaper could (and many\nwould, in a popular case) pirate from him, as soon as they could get the\nmatter set up. He could buy no more than he buys now when he arranges\nfor advance sheets from England, so that there may be simultaneous\npublication in the two countries. And success in England is of so much\nimportance towards the achievement of success in America, that I greatly\ndoubt whether previous publications in America would often be worth more\nto an American publisher or manager than simultaneous publication.\nConcerning the literary man in Parliament who would undertake to bring\nin a Bill for such an amendment of our copyright law, with weight enough\nto keep his heart unbroken while he should be getting it through its\nvarious lingering miseries, all I can say is--I decidedly don't know\nhim.\n\nOn that horrible Staplehurst day, I had not the slightest idea that I\nknew anyone in the train out of my own compartment. Mrs. Cowden\nClarke[97] wrote me afterwards, telling me in the main what you tell me,\nand I was astonished. It is remarkable that my watch (a special\nchronometer) has never gone quite correctly since, and to this day there\nsometimes comes over me, on a railway--in a hansom cab--or any sort of\nconveyance--for a few seconds, a vague sense of dread that I have no\npower to check. It comes and passes, but I cannot prevent its coming.\n\n                                  Believe me, always faithfully yours.",

First, as you are curious about the Oliver murder, I will tell you\nabout that trial of the same at which you _ought_ to have assisted.\nThere were about a hundred people present in all. I have changed my\nstage. Besides that back screen which you know so well, there are two\nlarge screens of the same colour, set off, one on either side, like the\n\"wings\" at a theatre. And besides these again, we have a quantity of\ncurtains of the same colour, with which to close in any width of room\nfrom wall to wall. Consequently, the figure is now completely isolated,\nand the slightest action becomes much more important. This was used for\nthe first time on the occasion. But behind the stage--the orchestra\nbeing very large and built for the accommodation of a numerous\nchorus--there was ready, on the level of the platform, a very long\ntable, beautifully lighted, with a large staff of men ready to open\noysters and set champagne-corks flying. Directly I had done, the screens\nbeing whisked off by my people, there was disclosed one of the prettiest\nbanquets you can imagine; and when all the people came up, and the gay\ndresses of the ladies were lighted by those powerful lights of mine, the\nscene was exquisitely pretty; the hall being newly decorated, and very\nelegantly; and the whole looking like a great bed of flowers and\ndiamonds.\n\nNow, you must know that all this company were, before the wine went\nround, unmistakably pale, and had horror-stricken faces. Next morning\nHarness (Fields knows--Rev. William--did an edition of Shakespeare--old\nfriend of the Kembles and Mrs. Siddons), writing to me about it, and\nsaying it was \"a most amazing and terrific thing,\" added, \"but I am\nbound to tell you that I had an almost irresistible impulse upon me to\n_scream_, and that, if anyone had cried out, I am certain I should have\nfollowed.\" He had no idea that, on the night, P----, the great ladies'\ndoctor, had taken me aside and said: \"My dear Dickens, you may rely upon\nit that if only one woman cries out when you murder the girl, there will\nbe a contagion of hysteria all over this place.\" It is impossible to\nsoften it without spoiling it, and you may suppose that I am rather\nanxious to discover how it goes on the 5th of January!!! We are afraid\nto announce it elsewhere, without knowing, except that I have thought it\npretty safe to put it up once in Dublin. I asked Mrs. K----, the famous\nactress, who was at the experiment: \"What do _you_ say? Do it or not?\"\n\"Why, of course, do it,\" she replied. \"Having got at such an effect as\nthat, it must be done. But,\" rolling her large black eyes very slowly,\nand speaking very distinctly, \"the public have been looking out for a\nsensation these last fifty years or so, and by Heaven they have got it!\"\nWith which words, and a long breath and a long stare, she became\nspeechless. Again, you may suppose that I am a little anxious!\n\nNot a day passes but Dolby and I talk about you both, and recall where\nwe were at the corresponding time of last year. My old likening of\nBoston to Edinburgh has been constantly revived within these last ten\ndays. There is a certain remarkable similarity of _tone_ between the two\nplaces. The audiences are curiously alike, except that the Edinburgh\naudience has a quicker sense of humour and is a little more genial. No\ndisparagement to Boston in this, because I consider an Edinburgh\naudience perfect.\n\nI trust, my dear Eugenius, that you have recognised yourself in a\ncertain Uncommercial, and also some small reference to a name rather\ndear to you? As an instance of how strangely something comic springs up\nin the midst of the direst misery, look to a succeeding Uncommercial,\ncalled \"A Small Star in the East,\" published to-day, by-the-bye. I have\ndescribed, _with exactness_, the poor places into which I went, and how\nthe people behaved, and what they said. I was wretched, looking on; and\nyet the boiler-maker and the poor man with the legs filled me with a\nsense of drollery not to be kept down by any pressure.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place, compounded of mists from the highlands and\nsmoke from the town factories, is crushing my eyebrows as I write, and\nit rains as it never does rain anywhere else, and always does rain here.\nIt is a dreadful place, though much improved and possessing a deal of\npublic spirit. Improvement is beginning to knock the old town of\nEdinburgh about, here and there; but the Canongate and the most\npicturesque of the horrible courts and wynds are not to be easily\nspoiled, or made fit for the poor wretches who people them to live in.\nEdinburgh is so changed as to its notabilities, that I had the only\nthree men left of the Wilson and Jeffrey time to dine with me there,\nlast Saturday.\n\nI think you will find \"Fatal Zero\" (by Percy Fitzgerald) a very curious\nanalysis of a mind, as the story advances. A new beginner in \"A. Y. R.\"\n(Hon. Mrs. Clifford, Kinglake's sister), who wrote a story in the series\njust finished, called \"The Abbot's Pool,\" has just sent me another\nstory. I have a strong impression that, with care, she will step into\nMrs. Gaskell's vacant place. Wills is no better, and I have work enough\neven in that direction.\n\nGod bless the woman with the black mittens for making me laugh so this\nmorning! I take her to be a kind of public-spirited Mrs. Sparsit, and as\nsuch take her to my bosom. God bless you both, my dear friends, in this\nChristmas and New Year time, and in all times, seasons, and places, and\nsend you to Gad's Hill with the next flowers!\n\n                                          Ever your most affectionate.",

Sikes) and uplift his voice again.\n\nThe chief officer of the _Russia_ (a capital fellow) was at the Reading\nlast night, and Dolby specially charged him with the care of you and\nyours. We shall be on the borders of Wales, and probably about Hereford,\nwhen you arrive. Dolby has insane projects of getting over here to meet\nyou; so amiably hopeful and obviously impracticable, that I encourage\nhim to the utmost. The regular little captain of the _Russia_, Cook, is\njust now changed into the _Cuba_, whence arise disputes of seniority,\netc. I wish he had been with you, for I liked him very much when I was\nhis passenger. I like to think of your being in _my_ ship!\n\n---- and ---- have been taking it by turns to be \"on the point of\ndeath,\" and have been complimenting one another greatly on the fineness\nof the point attained. My people got a very good impression of ----, and\nthought her a sincere and earnest little woman.\n\nThe _Russia_ hauls out into the stream to-day, and I fear her people may\nbe too busy to come to us to-night. But if any of them do, they shall\nhave the warmest of welcomes for your sake. (By-the-bye, a very good\nparty of seamen from the Queen's ship _Donegal_, lying in the Mersey,\nhave been told off to decorate St. George's Hall with the ship's\nbunting. They were all hanging on aloft upside down, holding to the\ngigantically high roof by nothing, this morning, in the most wonderfully\ncheerful manner.)\n\nMy son Charley has come for the dinner, and Chappell (my Proprietor,\nas--isn't it Wemmick?--says) is coming to-day, and Lord Dufferin (Mrs.\nNorton's nephew) is to come and make _the_ speech. I don't envy the\nfeelings of my noble friend when he sees the hall. Seriously, it is less\nadapted to speaking than Westminster Abbey, and is as large. . . .\n\nI hope you will see Fechter in a really clever piece by Wilkie.[103] Also\nyou will see the Academy Exhibition, which will be a very good one; and\nalso we will, please God, see everything and more, and everything else\nafter that. I begin to doubt and fear on the subject of your having a\nhorror of me after seeing the murder. I don't think a hand moved while I\nwas doing it last night, or an eye looked away. And there was a fixed\nexpression of horror of me, all over the theatre, which could not have\nbeen surpassed if I had been going to be hanged to that red velvet\ntable.

The simple fact is, that the rapid\nrailway travelling was stretched a hair's breadth too far, and that _I_\nought to have foreseen it. For, on the night before the last night of\nour reading in America, when Dolby was cheering me with a review of the\nsuccess, and the immediate prospect of the voyage home, I told him, to\nhis astonishment: \"I am too far gone, and too worn out to realise\nanything but my own exhaustion. Believe me, if I had to read but twice\nmore, instead of once, I couldn't do it.\" We were then just beyond our\nrecent number. And it was the travelling that I had felt throughout.\n\nThe sharp precautionary remedy of stopping instantly, was almost as\ninstantly successful the other day. I told Dr. Watson that he had never\nseen me knocked out of time, and that he had no idea of the rapidity\nwith which I should come up again.\n\nJust as three days' repose on the Atlantic steamer made me, in my\naltered appearance, the amazement of the captain, so this last week has\nset me up, thank God, in the most wonderful manner. The sense of\nexhaustion seems a dream already. Of course I shall train myself\ncarefully, nevertheless, all through the summer and autumn.\n\nI beg to send my kind regards to Mrs. Chappell, and I shall hope to see\nher and you at Teddington in the long bright days. It would disappoint\nme indeed if a lasting friendship did not come of our business\nrelations.\n\nIn the spring I trust I shall be able to report to you that I am ready\nto take my Farewells in London.

RUSDEN,\n\nAs I daresay some exaggerated accounts of my having been very ill have\nreached you, I begin with the true version of the case.\n\nI daresay I _should_ have been very ill if I had not suddenly stopped my\nFarewell Readings when there were yet five-and-twenty remaining to be\ngiven. I was quite exhausted, and was warned by the doctors to stop (for\nthe time) instantly. Acting on the advice, and going home into Kent for\nrest, I immediately began to recover, and within a fortnight was in the\nbrilliant condition in which I can now--thank God--report myself.\n\nI cannot thank you enough for your care of Plorn. I was quite prepared\nfor his not settling down without a lurch or two. I still hope that he\nmay take to colonial life. . . . In his letter to me about his leaving\nthe station to which he got through your kindness, he expresses his\ngratitude to you quite as strongly as if he had made a wonderful\nsuccess, and seems to have acquired no distaste for anything but the one\nindividual of whom he wrote that betrayed letter. But knowing the boy, I\nwant to try him fully.\n\nYou know all our public news, such as it is, at least as well as I do.\nMany people here (of whom I am one) do not like the look of American\nmatters.\n\nWhat I most fear is that the perpetual bluster of a party in the States\nwill at last set the patient British back up. And if our people begin to\nbluster too, and there should come into existence an exasperating\nwar-party on both sides, there will be great danger of a daily-widening\nbreach.\n\nThe first shriek of the first engine that traverses the San Francisco\nRailroad from end to end will be a death-warning to the disciples of Jo\nSmith. The moment the Mormon bubble gets touched by neighbours it will\nbreak. Similarly, the red man's course is very nearly run. A scalped\nstoker is the outward and visible sign of his utter extermination. Not\nQuakers enough to reach from here to Jerusalem will save him by the term\nof a single year.\n\nI don't know how it may be with you, but it is the fashion here to be\nabsolutely certain that the Emperor of the French is fastened by\nProvidence and the fates on a throne of adamant expressly constructed\nfor him since the foundations of the universe were laid.\n\nHe knows better, and so do the police of Paris, and both powers must be\ngrimly entertained by the resolute British belief, knowing what they\nhave known, and doing what they have done through the last ten years.\nWhat Victor Hugo calls \"the drop-curtain, behind which is constructing\nthe great last act of the French Revolution,\" has been a little shaken\nat the bottom lately, however. One seems to see the feet of a rather\nlarge chorus getting ready.\n\nI enclose a letter for Plorn to your care, not knowing how to address\nhim. Forgive me for so doing (I write to Alfred direct), and believe me,\nmy dear Mr. Rusden,\n\n                                    Yours faithfully and much obliged.",

RUSDEN,\n\nThis very day a great meeting is announced to come off in London, as a\ndemonstration in favour of a Fenian \"amnesty.\" No doubt its numbers and\nimportance are ridiculously over-estimated, but I believe the gathering\nwill turn out to be big enough to be a very serious obstruction in the\nLondon streets. I have a great doubt whether such demonstrations ought\nto be allowed. They are bad as a precedent, and they unquestionably\ninterfere with the general liberty and freedom of the subject.\n\nMoreover, the time must come when this kind of threat and defiance will\nhave to be forcibly stopped, and when the unreasonable toleration of it\nwill lead to a sacrifice of life among the comparatively innocent\nlookers-on that might have been avoided but for a false confidence on\ntheir part, engendered in the damnable system of _laisser-aller_. You\nsee how right we were, you and I, in our last correspondence on this\nhead, and how desperately unsatisfactory the condition of Ireland is,\nespecially when considered with a reference to America. The Government\nhas, through Mr. Gladstone, just now spoken out boldly in reference to\nthe desired amnesty. (So much the better for them or they would\nunquestionably have gone by the board.) Still there is an uneasy feeling\nabroad that Mr. Gladstone himself would grant this amnesty if he dared,\nand that there is a great weakness in the rest of their Irish policy.\nAnd this feeling is very strong amongst the noisiest Irish howlers.\nMeanwhile, the newspapers go on arguing Irish matters as if the Irish\nwere a reasonable people, in which immense assumption I, for one, have\nnot the smallest faith.\n\nAgain, I have to thank you most heartily for your kindness to my two\nboys. It is impossible to predict how Plorn will settle down, or come\nout of the effort to do so. But he has unquestionably an affectionate\nnature, and a certain romantic touch in him. Both of these qualities\nare, I hope, more impressible for good than for evil, and I trust in God\nfor the rest.\n\nThe news of Lord Derby's death will reach you, I suppose, at about the\nsame time as this letter. A rash, impetuous, passionate man; but a great\nloss for his party, as a man of mind and mark. I was staying last June\nwith Lord Russell--six or seven years older, but (except for being\nrather deaf) in wonderful preservation, and brighter and more\ncompletely armed at all points than I have seen him these twenty years.\n\nAs this need not be posted till Friday, I shall leave it open for a\nfinal word or two; and am until then, and then, and always afterwards,\nmy dear Mr. Rusden,\n\n                                       Your faithful and much obliged.\n\n\n                                                     _Thursday, 28th._\n\nWe have no news in England except two slight changes in the Government\nconsequent on Layard's becoming our Minister at Madrid. He is not long\nmarried to a charming lady, and will be far better in Spain than in the\nHouse of Commons. The Ministry are now holding councils on the Irish\nLand Tenure question, which is the next difficulty they have to deal\nwith, as you know. Last Sunday's meeting was a preposterous failure;\nstill, it brought together in the streets of London all the ruffian part\nof the population of London, and that is a serious evil which any one of\na thousand accidents might render mischievous. There is no existing law,\nhowever, to stop these assemblages, so that they keep moving while in\nthe streets.\n\nThe Government was undoubtedly wrong when it considered it had the right\nto close Hyde Park; that is now universally conceded.\n\nI write to Alfred and Plorn both by this mail.

The conservatory is completed,\nand is a brilliant success; but an expensive one!\n\nI should be quite ashamed of not having written to you and my dear Mrs.\nFields before now, if I didn't know that you will both understand how\noccupied I am, and how naturally, when I put my papers away for the day,\nI get up and fly. I have a large room here, with three fine windows,\noverlooking the Park--unsurpassable for airiness and cheerfulness.\n\nYou saw the announcement of the death of poor dear Harness. The\ncircumstances are curious. He wrote to his old friend the Dean of Battle\nsaying he would come to visit him on that day (the day of his death).\nThe Dean wrote back: \"Come next day, instead, as we are obliged to go\nout to dinner, and you will be alone.\" Harness told his sister a little\nimpatiently that he _must_ go on the first-named day; that he had made\nup his mind to go, and MUST. He had been getting himself ready for\ndinner, and came to a part of the staircase whence two doors\nopened--one, upon another level passage; one, upon a flight of stone\nsteps. He opened the wrong door, fell down the steps, injured himself\nvery severely, and died in a few hours.\n\nYou will know--_I_ don't--what Fechter's success is in America at the\ntime of this present writing. In his farewell performances at the\nPrincess's he acted very finely. I thought the three first acts of his\nHamlet very much better than I had ever thought them before--and I\nalways thought very highly of them. We gave him a foaming stirrup cup at\nGad's Hill.\n\nForster (who has been ill with his bronchitis again) thinks No. 2 of the\nnew book (\"Edwin Drood\") a clincher,--I mean that word (as his own\nexpression) for _Clincher_. There is a curious interest steadily working\nup to No. 5, which requires a great deal of art and self-denial. I think\nalso, apart from character and picturesqueness, that the young people\nare placed in a very novel situation. So I hope--at Nos. 5 and 6, the\nstory will turn upon an interest suspended until the end.\n\nI can't believe it, and don't, and won't, but they say Harry's\ntwenty-first birthday is next Sunday. I have entered him at the Temple\njust now; and if he don't get a fellowship at Trinity Hall when his time\ncomes, I shall be disappointed, if in the present disappointed state of\nexistence.\n\nI hope you may have met with the little touch of Radicalism I gave them\nat Birmingham in the words of Buckle? With pride I observe that it makes\nthe regular political traders, of all sorts, perfectly mad. Such was my\nintentions, as a grateful acknowledgment of having been misrepresented.\n\nI think Mrs. ----'s prose very admirable; but I don't believe it! No, I\ndo _not_. My conviction is that those islanders get frightfully bored by\nthe islands, and wish they had never set eyes upon them!\n\nCharley Collins has done a charming cover for the monthly part of the\nnew book. At the very earnest representations of Millais (and after\nhaving seen a great number of his drawings) I am going to engage with a\nnew man; retaining of course, C. C.'s cover aforesaid.[107] Katie has made\nsome more capital portraits, and is always improving.\n\nMy dear Mrs. Fields, if \"He\" (made proud by chairs and bloated by\npictures) does not give you my dear love, let us conspire against him\nwhen you find him out, and exclude him from all future confidences.\nUntil then,\n\n                                    Ever affectionately yours and his.",

RUSDEN,\n\nI received your most interesting and clear-sighted letter about Plorn\njust before the departure of the last mail from here to you. I did not\nanswer then because another incoming mail was nearly due, and I expected\n(knowing Plorn so well) that some communication from him such as he made\nto you would come to me. I was not mistaken. The same arguing of the\nsquatter question--vegetables and all--appeared. This gave me an\nopportunity of touching on those points by this mail, without in the\nleast compromising you. I cannot too completely express my concurrence\nwith your excellent idea that his correspondence with you should be\nregarded as confidential. Just as I could not possibly suggest a word\nmore neatly to the point, or more thoughtfully addressed, to such a\nyoung man than your reply to his letter, I hope you will excuse my\nsaying that it is a perfect model of tact, good sense, and good feeling.\nI had been struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of his\nholding any other position in Australasia than his present position, and\nhad inferred from it a homeward tendency. What is most curious to me is\nthat he is very sensible, and yet does not seem to understand that he\nhas qualified himself for no public examinations in the old country, and\ncould not possibly hold his own against any competition for anything to\nwhich I could get him nominated.\n\nBut I must not trouble you about my boys as if they were yours. It is\nenough that I can never thank you for your goodness to them in a\ngenerous consideration of me.\n\nI believe the truth as to France to be that a citizen Frenchman never\nforgives, and that Napoleon will never live down the _coup d'\u00e9tat_. This\nmakes it enormously difficult for any well-advised English newspaper to\nsupport him, and pretend not to know on what a volcano his throne is\nset. Informed as to his designs on the one hand, and the perpetual\nuneasiness of his police on the other (to say nothing of a doubtful\narmy), _The Times_ has a difficult game to play. My own impression is\nthat if it were played too boldly for him, the old deplorable national\nantagonism would revive in his going down. That the wind will pass over\nhis Imperiality on the sands of France I have not the slightest doubt.\nIn no country on the earth, but least of all there, can you seize people\nin their houses on political warrants, and kill in the streets, on no\nwarrant at all, without raising a gigantic Nemesis--not very reasonable\nin detail, perhaps, but none the less terrible for that.\n\nThe commonest dog or man driven mad is a much more alarming creature\nthan the same individuality in a sober and commonplace condition.\n\nYour friend ---- ---- is setting the world right generally all round\n(including the flattened ends, the two poles), and, as a Minister said\nto me the other day, \"has the one little fault of omniscience.\"\n\nYou will probably have read before now that I am going to be everything\nthe Queen can make me.[111] If my authority be worth anything believe on\nit that I am going to be nothing but what I am, and that that includes\nmy being as long as I live,\n\n                                   Your faithful and heartily obliged.",
