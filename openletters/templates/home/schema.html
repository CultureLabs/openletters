    <h2>Open Correspondence Schema</h2>
    <p>The Open Correspondence project re-uses schemas where possible.</p>

    <p>It uses <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dublin Core</a>,
     <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">Friend of a Friend</a> and <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~pan/damltime/time-entry.owl#">OWL time</a>.
    There are sections of the letter that these schemas do not cover.
    The letter schema is designed to patch these holes to allow users to link letters and the letter texts. </p>
    
    <h3>Letter schema</h3>
    
    <p>Namespace: http://purl.org/letter</p>
    
    <h4>Character</h4>
    <p>A fictional person who is referenced in the text. This element is used to disambiguated between fictional and non-fictional characters. Non-fictional, i.e. real people, are denoted by foaf:Person. Character is a subset of foaf:Person and is intended for fictional people. For example, in a letter from an author to an agent, the author may describing their latest project.</p>
    
    <h4>Correspondent</h4>
    <p>This field denotes the correspondent of the letter.  It is a subset of foaf:Person as it should denote a real person. (However it is perfectly possible for a fictional letter to be written and in this case it would perhaps be inappropriate to use foaf:Person).<br />
    foaf:nick can be used to highlight the different ways that the correspondent is addressed by the author.</p>
    
    <h4>personReferred</h4>
    <p>This field refers to a person who is referred to in the body of the letter</p>
    
    <h4>textReferred</h4>
    <p>This refers to a text (book, verse or similar) which is referred to in the letter being serialised. It is intended to allow the building of graphs between the letters where a text is being referred to so that a graph can be built of what an author was doing or thinking about a text around the time or after writing the text. It is designed to allow for some contextualisation of the referred work. It could also be used to build a reading list, possible influences or forgotten works that the author was aware of at the time.</p>
